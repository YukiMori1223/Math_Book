  abstract  = {Accurate prediction of the discharge rate from hoppers is important in many industrial processes involving the handling of granular materials. The present work investigates the parameters affecting the discharge rate of a wet cohesive system from a quasi-3-D, rectangular hopper using the discrete element method (DEM). The cohesion between the particles is described by a pendular liquid bridge force model and the strength of the cohesive bond is characterized by a Bond number. The Beverloo correlation is applied to cohesive systems by modifying the Beverloo constant as a function of Bond number. The predictions obtained from this modified correlation fit the simulation data reasonably well. In addition, the effect of hopper angle in cohesive systems is shown to follow a trend similar to cohesionless systems, where the discharge rate is insensitive to changes in hopper angle except below a critical angle (with respect to the vertical) where the discharge rate increases rapidly. This critical angle of flow decreases with increasing cohesion. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The first part of this study describes a direct approach via optimization of the interfacial energy of the liquid bridge system. The results, referred to as the optimal solutions, can be used as reference values for the exact solutions of static liquid bridges. In the second part, a force model is presented based on a toroidal approximation of the liquid bridge profile. Particularly, its advantage resides in the generality, which is applicable to a wide range of liquid volumes, contact angles and radius ratios. Predictions by the proposed model are validated against experimental data and optimal solution, from which good agreements are obtained. Numerical tests indicate that the relative error by the proposed model is generally below 10% within a wide range of contact angles and liquid volumes, showing its satisfactory accuracy for calculating the capillary force. It is expected that the present model will be useful for practical numerical analysis of wet granular materials.},

Different flow regimes were observed by varying the surface tension of liquid and keeping other conditions unchanged. The analysis of the concentration and mean square displacement of particles indicated that the axial motion of wet particles was a diffusive process characterised by Fick's law. Particle diffusivity decreased with increasing inter-particle cohesion and drum filling level but increased with increasing drum rotation speed. Two competing mechanisms were proposed to explain these effects. A theoretical model based on the relation between local diffusivity and shear rate was developed to predict particle diffusivity as a function of drum operation conditions. It was also observed that despite the high inhomogeneity of particle flow in rotating drums, the mean diffusivity of flow exhibited a strong correlation with granular temperature, defined as the mean square fluctuating velocity of particles. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Different from previous studies, where idealized spherical materials (glass beads) are typically used, here experiments on irregular wet calcium carbonate particles (coarse sand) were carried out and compared with glass sphere results. Particles of different sizes (in the range 0.8-5 mm) were mixed with water from 0% to 4% w/w and poured in a rectangular box. Flow was then triggered by removing a lateral wall of the box. The measured runout distances showed marked differences between the two types of materials which could not be explained only in terms of particle shape or capillary forces. Ring shear tests and 3D tomographic reconstructions of the liquid distribution in the materials highlighted the role of additional mechanisms related to liquid spreading at the particle surface, inter-particle friction, and contact lubrication.},

  abstract = {The Discrete Element Method was coupled with a capillary liquid bridge force model for computational studies of pattern formation in vibrated granular beds containing dry or wet granular materials. Depending on the vibration conditions applied, hexagonal, stripes, or cellular pattern was observed in the dry vibrated granular bed. In each of these cases, the same hexagonal, stripes, or cellular pattern was also observed in the spatial distribution of the magnitudes of particle-particle collision forces prior to the formation of the corresponding actual pattern in physical distributions of the particles. This seemed to suggest that the pattern formation phenomenon of vibrated granular bed systemsmight be the result of a two-dimensional Newton's cradle effect. In the presence of a small amount of wetness, these patterns were no longer formed in the vibrated granular beds under the same corresponding set of vibration conditions. Despite the relatively much weaker capillary forces arising from the simulated liquid bridges between particles compared with particle-particle collision forces, the spatial distributions of these collision forces, physical distributions of particles, as well as time profiles of average collision forces were altered significantly in comparison with the corresponding distributions and profiles observed for the dry vibrated granular beds. This seemed to suggest the presence of a two-dimensional Stokes' cradle effect in these wet vibrated granular bed systems which disrupted the formation of patterns in the wet granular materials that would have been observed in their dry counterparts. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Gas-solid-liquid flows are widely found in chemical engineering, e.g. the processes of mixing, wet ball milling, and screw kneading, for which the numerical modeling is now a pressing research topic to help improve the design and investigate operational conditions. On the other hand, computational challenges are posed for existing methods in modeling the interphase interactions and complex boundaries within such three-phase systems. In this paper, an Eulerian-Lagrangian numerical model, specifically the DEM-VOF method, is presented for three-dimensional simulations of gas-solid-liquid flows. The fluid motion is solved by using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based approach with gas-liquid interface capturing provided by the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method. The particle phase is tracked by the discrete element method (DEM) as discrete entities. The fluid-particle coupling is achieved by the volume-averaging technique wherein a well-established empirical closure is adopted for the description of hydrodynamic forces. Particularly, the modeling of arbitrary-shaped walls and moving boundaries is addressed via the introduction of signed distance function (SDF) representation and immersed boundary (IB) method, which was proved to be highly efficient for gas-solid-liquid systems interacting with complex geometries. Special attentions when computing fluid-particle interactions near t hose boundaries are raised and their treatments are also discussed. Various model verifications and validation tests are performed in this study to show the validity and capability of the DEM-VOF method. By comparing with analytical solutions and experimental data, we generally find good agreements from the simulation results, thereby highlighting its potential in accurately modeling complicated gas-solid-liquid flows. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first report that successfully couples the DEM to a VOF solver with non-trivial wall boundaries.},

An accurate prediction of the profile of a liquid bridge is significantly important in particulate flows, while it is an analytically challenging task as well. In this paper, we develop an asymptotic solution for a catenoid liquid bridge profile, which is the minimal surface ensuring the minimum total surface energy. Our asymptotic solution is based on a rapid convergent predictor-corrector algorithm that considers different factors including boundary conditions, volume conservation, and geometrical relations while providing the relationship between the liquid bridge profile, bridge radius, half-filling angles, and creeping distances. Therefore, this asymptotic solution of the catenoid of the liquid bridge is applicable to general scenarios of any two neighboring particles of either equal or different sizes having identical or different contact angles. In order to validate the proposed asymptotic solution, we performed comprehensive experiments where the observed and predicted liquid bridge profiles and the resultant capillary forces from both the approaches are found closely matching. Moreover, we also investigate and report the influence of the radii ratio, contact angles, particle distances, and the liquid bridge volumes on its profiles.},

In order to study this problem, some experimental collapse tests conducted in a rectangular box were reproduced with a 1:1 scale numerical model using the Discrete Element Method. In simulations the effect of the capillary bridges has been investigated implementing a mid-range attractive force between particles based on the minimum energy approach. Also a bonding-debonding mechanism was incorporated in the algorithm and the volume of each sessile drop on the particle surface was considered during its motion. The influence of some variables was investigated with respect to the final slope profiles and the runout lengths: the initial liquid content, the particle size, the solid density, the liquid surface tension, and the liquid-solid contact angle. Also the crucial effect of the confinement walls on the collapse phenomenon was investigated: wet particles adhere to the lateral walls providing a higher flow resistance in comparison to the same material in dry conditions. It was observed that particles with largest path-lengths are localized near the movable wall at a middle-height of the initial column sample. Other particles at the surface moves in a rigid way especially if they were wet and with a low solid density. The "fidelity" of each particle with respect to the nearest neighbours was evaluated allowing to recognize the emergence of clusters of particles and rigid parts, to extract the failure surface and to localize where debonding mechanisms concentrate in the wet case. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

The liquid-bridge force is introduced to the discrete element method in the investigation of the behavior of wet particles. However, existing numerical modeling has problems from the viewpoint of the effect of cohesion in contact states. Specifically, the cohesive force is treated as a constant value for contact states. This means the effect of the cohesive force is not only dependent on the spring constant in the discrete element simulation but is also frequently overestimated. To solve this problem, the present study developed a numerical contact model considering quantitatively the effect of the cohesive force in contact states and validated the model for a pan pelletizer. The behaviors and cascading angles of wet particles in simulation and experiments were in good agreement and the validity of the contact model was thus demonstrated.

In this study, the computational fluid dynamic–discrete element method with the consideration of rolling friction was applied to evaluate the mixing behaviors of binary mixtures comprising spherocylindrical particles and spherical particles in a fluidized bed. The simulation results indicate that the differences between rotational particle velocities were higher than those of translational particle velocities for spherical and non-spherical particles when well mixed. Moreover, as the volume fraction of the spherocylindrical particles increases, translational and rotational granular temperatures gradually increase. In addition, the addition of the spherical particles makes the spherocylindrical particles preferably distributed in a vertical orientation.},

The motion of individual particles is modeled by DEM, and the gas motion is modeled by the k- $\epsilon$ two equation turbulent model. The mixing quality is described by the Lacey mixing index, it is evaluated in terms of the mixing degree at the mixing equilibrium and the time required reaching the steady value. The state of mixing of uniform particles is studied by analyzing the effect of particle shape, density and spouting gas velocity. For binary systems, the effects of component shape and size are examined. The results show that spouting gas velocity and particle properties are important parameters influencing particle mixing quality in spouted bed. The mixing quality is found to be sensitive to particle shape, the spheres mix faster and more homogeneous than corns. In monocomponent corn system, the mixing quality increases with increasing of gas velocity and decrease with increasing particle density, and it is sensitive to particle shapes, the spheres mix faster and more homogeneous than corns. In binary corn-sphere system, particles with closer sizes and operated at higher gas velocity have better mixing quality. Besides, the mixing mechanism of corn-shaped particles is discussed based on the mixing process of monocomponent and binary systems. It is found that particles of different shapes, sizes and densities can have different trajectories in the fountain region, leads to a different radial landing position on the top of the annulus, and the subsequent path through the annulus region varies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

In DEM the dices are approximated by polyhedra and smoothed polyhedra respectively and hence allow examining the influence of sharply-edged and smooth particle geometries on the mechanical behavior. Simulation results are in good general agreement with the experiments and hence demonstrate the adequacy of DEM as well as polyhedral and smoothed polyhedral approximation schemes to simulate non-spherical particle geometries. It was observed that an increase of particle angularity leads to an increase of the dynamic angle of repose. On the other hand, while spheres mix faster than the polyhedral dices, no significant difference in the mixing behaviors of the dices can be observed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {Blending and sampling of granular materials are discussed in the context of pharmaceutical operations. Several experiments are used to compare the state of the art with regulatory expectations, especially those highlighted in a recent court ruling generally known as the 'Barr Decision'. It is shown that samples obtained using thief probes can exhibit considerable errors, possibly leading to misleading results. The effects of sample size and number of samples are examined using an alternative characterization technique in which a powder mixture is solidified through infiltration with a polymer solution, sliced, and examined using image analysis. It is shown that number of samples is the most important parameter controlling the accuracy of the characterization. While a homogeneous mixture can be accurately characterized using just 30 samples, poorly mixed systems require hundreds of samples. It is also shown that an accurate characterization of a mixture inside a blender may not be indicative of the final state of the mixture after additional processing steps.},

  abstract  = {Studies on powder mixing in industrial mixers are crucial for the improved criteria of mixing equipment design and optimization within various mixing unit operations. In the present study, a series of simulation for the powder mixing in an elaborately designed mixer, called a cross-torus paddle mixer, is conducted using the Advanced DEM-CFD method. The effects of various operational parameters on the mixing performance are analyzed and discussed in detail. Through these investigations, it is found that rotational speed, filling level, liquid viscosity, and paddle obliquity can significantly affect mixing performance. Owing to a much-enhanced convective motion of particles, a higher rotational speed exhibits a more efficient mixing process. Smaller number of particles inside the vessel shows the better mixing performance, which is attributed to an enhanced diffusive motion of particles. Decreasing the liquid viscosity or increasing the paddle obliquity can also result in a more efficient mixing in a diffusive dominant mode. By performing the simulation of mixing behavior in a mono-dispersed system, the present work provides significant evidence and novel insights to further understand the mixing mechanisms.},

Arising from this complexity, relatively few studies to obtain fundamental understanding of particle motion and mixing mechanisms have been reported. Particle motion within a cylindrical vessel of a Turbula mixer has been measured for 2 mm glass spheres using Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT) in a 2 l blending mixing vessel at 50% fill level. These data are compared to results from Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations previously published by the authors. PEPT mixing experiments, using a single particle tracer, gave qualitatively similar trends to the DEM predictions for axial and radial dispersion as well as for the axial displacement statistics at different operational speeds. Both experimental and simulation results indicate a minimum mixing efficiency at ca. 46 rpm. The occupancy plots also show a non-linear relationship with the operating speed. These results add further evidence to a transition between two flow and mixing regimes. Despite the similarity in overall flow and mixing behaviour measured and predicted, including the mixing speed at which the flow behaviour transition occurs, a systematic offset between measured and predicted result is observed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In this study, the synchrotron radiation X-ray computed microtomography (SR-$\mu$CT) was used non-invasively to monitor blend homogeneity of binary mixtures. Granular samples of microcrystalline cellulose and starch were characterized using the SR-$\mu$CT individually. Simultaneously, particle distribution was investigated by calculating the frequency distribution of a statistic for testing sphericity. Then, the microcrystalline cellulose and starch granules were blended in a cylindrical container. Influences of the time of rotations TR and the time of vibration TV on the mixture homogeneity were studied with the SR-$\mu$CT and statistical evaluation. The mixing index is also adopted to evaluate the mixture homogeneity of the particle system. The results showed that mixture homogeneity is improved with increasing TR. Furthermore, segregation increased with longer T V when particles are different in size and shape. The larger starch granules of non-spherical shape have a tendency to rise to the top, while the smaller microcrystalline cellulose granules which are spherical tend to migrate to the bottom of the mixture. Therefore, we demonstrate that SR-$\mu$CT can investigate the mixing and segregation of granular materials in three-dimensions combined with statistic method. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

This study, which is the first in a series of two parts, uses existing mixing indices and a new criterion called the " percentage of homogeneity" (H%) to assess image homogeneity. Image analysis techniques use feature extraction procedures to extract information from images subjected to treatments including colour segmentation and binarization. The surface distribution of components was determined by macropixel analysis, which splits an image into non-overlapping blocks of a preset size and calculates several statistical parameters for the resulting divisional structure. Such parameters were used to compute mixing indices. In this work, we explored the potential of image processing in combination with mixing indices and H% for assessing blending end-point and component distribution on images. As a simplified test, an arrangement of binary and ternary systems of coloured particles was mixed collecting at-line multispectral (MSI) and non-invasive RGB pictures at preset intervals. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

  abstract  = {Gas-solid two-phase flow features temporal-spatial multi-scale structures. Calculation of characteristic scales for an air/FCC (fluid-catalytic-cracking particle) flow indicates that the lack of scale separation entails a structure-dependent modeling approach even on the sub-grid level. For solving this problem, the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model is extended and coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) through calculation of a structure-dependent drag coefficient in each grid, for which the schemes EMMS/sub-grid and EMMS/matrix are presented. Numerical analysis of the extended EMMS model suggests that gas and particles tend to achieve a compromise of flow dominance by gas finding the way with less resistance and particles clustering. So the dilute-phase part of drag force can be neglected and the major flow resistance arises from inside the dense-phase aggregate and over the interface. The inertial difference between the dense phase and the interface results in breakup or formation of particle clusters. The integrated approach is further verified through numerical description of the choking point demarcating the flow regime transition between the dilute pneumatic transport and the all-dense flow. Simulation shows that usual practice with assignment of only gas velocity and solids flux is insufficient for determination of the dense bottom height in a riser, and this can be attributed to the absence of another independent variable, solids inventory or imposed pressure drop. This critical phenomenon has been identified by earlier experiments, but most simulation practitioners remain unaware of it. More verification of the model is performed through visualization of micro-scale dynamics, characterization of meso-scale clusters and quantification of macro-scale distribution of two-phase parameters. Good agreement with experimental evidence is quite encouraging even quantitatively. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The platform is an advanced multi-physics simulation technology that combines flexibility and versatility to establish the next generation of multi-physics and multi-scale simulation tools. For this purpose, the simulation framework relies on coupling various predictive tools based on an Eulerian and Lagrangian approach. The Eulerian approach represents the wide field of continuum models; the Lagrangian approach is perfect for characterising discrete phases. Continuum models thus include classical simulation tools, such as computational fluid dynamics simulation and finite element analysis, while an extended configuration of the classical discrete element method addresses the discrete (e.g., particulate) phase. Apart from predicting the trajectories of individual particles, XDEM-suite extends the application of the XDEM to estimating the thermodynamic state of each particle using advanced and optimised algorithms. The thermodynamic state may include temperature and species distributions due to chemical reaction and external heat sources. Hence, coupling these extended features with either computational fluid dynamics simulation or finite element analysis opens a wide range of applications as diverse as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, food processing, mining, construction and agricultural machinery, metals manufacturing, energy production and systems biology.},

Spherical particles with well known contact force models remain popular in DEM due to their relative simplicity in terms of ease of implementation and low computational cost. However, in real applications particles are mostly non-spherical, and more sophisticated particle shape models, like superquadric shape, must be introduced in DEM. The superquadric shape can be considered as an extension of spherical or ellipsoidal particles and can be used for modeling of spheres, ellip-soids, cylinder-like and box(dice)-like particles just varying five shape parameters. In this study we present an efficient C++ implementation of superquadric particles within the open-source and parallel DEM package LIGGGHTS. To reduce computational time several ideas are employed. In the particle-particle contact detection routine we use the minimum bounding spheres and the oriented bounding boxes to reduce the number of potential contact pairs. For the particle-wall contact an accurate analytical solution was found. We present all necessary mathematics for the contact detection and contact force calculation. The superquadric DEM code implementation was verified on test cases such as angle of repose and hopper/silo discharge. The simulation results are in good agreement with experimental data and are presented in this paper. We show adequacy of the superquadric shape B Alexander Podlozhnyuk model and robustness of the implemented superquadric DEM code.},

  abstract  = {In the ore milling process, the ore particles are usually irregular polyhedrons, and the grinding media are often spherical. The need for accurate simulation of this process calls for a contact algorithm between the polyhedron and sphere, achieving a balance of accuracy, stability, and efficiency. For this purpose, we propose a polyhedron-sphere contact model based on the deepest point method. Experiments and simulation studies by discrete element method (DEM) are conducted to test this model's accuracy in a hexahedral box and a lab-scale horizontal drum with lifters. Then, systematic research is carried out for an industrial semi-automatic grinding (SAG) mill to explore the effect of particle shape. To reveal the advantage over the traditional spherical DEM model, the polyhedron-sphere (PH-SP) grinding system is compared with a pure spherical grinding system. Results are discussed from the motion behavior particles, power consumption, collision energy on ore and liner, and liner wear. The results show that the charging of particles in the PH-SP grinding system is blocked to a certain extent by polyhedral particles, both the power consumption and energy utilization efficiency increase somewhat, the large energy collision between ore and liner has increased significantly. The liner wear of the PH-SP grinding system is more severe than the pure spherical grinding system, which indicates that the new model is necessary for more accurate prediction of the grinding process.},

In this work, a novel method is presented for calculating contact force interactions between polyhedral particles. A contact between two polyhedra is decomposed as a set of contacts between individual polygonal facets. For each polygon-polygon contact, an individual contact force is obtained by integrating a linear pressure over the area of its intersection. Both convex as well as partially concave polyhedra can be accurately represented. The proposed algorithm is validated by comparing to previously published experimental and computational gravitational particle depositions of identical cubes. Finally, the model is demonstrated in simulations of gravitational packing of various other polyhedral shapes.},

To this end, the relative movement by rolling is related to the relative rotation between two particles with a common contact, which makes it possible to generalize the conservation law of angular momentum for a more general case than the moments can be transmitted through contacts. Not only the generation of large voids inside a shear band but also the high gradient of particle rotation along the shear band boundaries can be reproduced, in a manner quite similar to those of natural granular soils, when the rolling resistance at contacts is considered. The development of columns is a common feature that appears in the strain hardening process, and buckling of the columns parallels the development of shear bands. The generation of large voids and the high gradient of particle rotation are produced as a result of the buckling of the columns.},

  abstract  = {Granular flow in rotating drums exhibits complex phenomena which are further complicated by the presence of liquids. This paper reviews our recent work on flow of wet particles in rotating drums based on the discrete element method (DEM) simulations. The DEM model was validated by comparing the simulation results with experimental measurements. Particle flow at quasi-static and dynamic states was investigated. In the quasi-static state with the drum rotating at low speeds, wet particle bed failed through avalanche and slow structural change was identified prior to the avalanches. In the dynamic state, flow transited from continuous to avalanche flow with increasing liquid surface tension and a plug flow was developed on the bed surface. Particle mixing in both transverse and axial directions was studied. While cohesion in general reduced transverse mixing, enhanced mixing of wet particles was also observed, which was explained by a theory based on particle circulation period. On the other hand, the axial mixing was well described by Fick's law of diffusion and particle diffusivity decreased with increasing cohesion. A correlation was observed between particle diffusivity and granular temperature. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Thus, we develop a numerical method for simulating multiphase flow with beads and particulates using a discrete element method and computational fluid dynamics, and we use the four-way coupling simulation to study the fluid-bead-particulate-coupled phenomenon that occurs in a simple shear box. The results show that the dominant force causing aggregate disintegration is the fluid force, rather than the bead contact force, because aggregates rarely collide with beads, contact force of which is too small to disintegrate aggregates. Furthermore, aggregates with strong aggregation force are effectively disintegrated by the fluid flow with a dominant high pure-shear rate induced near the bead surfaces by the expansive force, rather than the compressive force.},

  abstract  = {The Lagrangian moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) method has potential to simulate free-surface and multiphase flows. However, the chaotic distribution of particles can decrease accuracy and reliability in the conventional MPS method. In this study, a new Laplacian model is proposed by removing the errors associated with first-order partial derivatives based on a corrected matrix. Therefore, a corrective matrix is applied to all the MPS discretization models to enhance computational accuracy. Then, the developed corrected models are coupled into our previous multiphase MPS methods. Separate stabilizing strategies are developed for internal and free-surface particles. Specifically, particle shifting is applied to internal particles. Meanwhile, a conservative pressure gradient model and a modified optimized particle shifting scheme are applied to free-surface particles to produce the required adjustments in surface normal and tangent directions, respectively. The simulations of a multifluid pressure oscillation flow and a bubble rising flow demonstrate the accuracy improvements of the corrective matrix. The elliptical drop deformation demonstrates the stability/accuracy improvement of the present stabilizing strategies at free surface. Finally, a turbulent multiphase flow with complicated interface fragmentation and coalescence is simulated to demonstrate the capability of the developed method.},

DPM is computationally efficient but its accuracy is significantly dependent on the selection of interphase interaction models, whereas DNS is accurate but computationally expensive. In this work, we proposed a multi-scale method, DPM-DNS, where DNS of a relaxation process with modest computational cost was dynamically coupled to the DPM framework to evaluate the interphase force more accurately, thanks to the large density ratio and particle Stokes number in gas-solid flow. The simulation results demonstrated that the resultant interphase force distribution and concentration profiles calculated by DPM-DNS are almost identical to pure DNS, but the computational speed is more than 30 times higher than DNS, though still much lower than DPM. Future work on the relaxation scheme and the mapping algorithm between DPM and DNS may improve the efficiency of DPM-DNS more significantly.},

Simulations are performed using an immersed boundary method, together with the methodology developed in our earlier work for accurate prediction of gas-solid interactions at relatively low grid resolutions. This modelling approach provides detailed information on the gas flow and the motion of individual particles, which allows for a priori calculation of the bed hydrodynamics. Experimental measurements of solids mean motion are conducted using a combined technique of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Digital Image Analysis (DIA). Further, the PIV technique is extended and applied for instantaneous measurements of the particle granular temperature, which is the key characteristics of particle velocity fluctuations. For the first time, this paper reports a direct comparison in great detail between DNS results and experimental data for realistic gas fluidization. The detailed comparison reveals a reasonably good agreement with respect to the time-averaged solids motion and the pressure fluctuations. In addition, the granular temperatures calculated from the simulations agree well with the experimental data, but provide more details with respect to the variations corresponding to bubble formation and eruption. From our investigation, it also becomes clear that attention should be paid on the measurement and interpretation of the granular temperature.},

This paper reports on the use of Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT) in order to visualise and quantify the features of the powder movement inside a laboratory-scale GPCG-1 fluidised bed coater (Glatt GmbH, Germany) with a tapered (conical) chamber. In all cases, a clear circulating motion, upwards in the centre and downwards along the walls, was revealed. This circulating pattern lends itself to operations such as particle coating, where controlled application of the coating onto the particles is essential. In contrast to the fluidisation patterns observed in cylindrical fluidised beds or spouted beds without a draft tube, radial movement was stronger and occurred at all heights in the powder bed. By introducing a binary nozzle and increasing the nozzle atomisation air pressure, the circulating motion of the fluidised particles in a tapered vessel was found to be accelerated. When spraying a coating solution downwards onto the fluidised powder particles, effects on the particle motion, depending on coating solution properties and process parameters, were observed. Besides visualisation, PEPT was also used to derive quantitative information such as bed height and particle circulation time, as well as to investigate the size of the coating zone. Generally, it was demonstrated that PEPT can be successfully used to characterise the particle motion in a tapered fluidised bed under both drying and coating conditions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Instantaneous snapshots of particle velocity and particle position were acquired for gas velocities U below and above the minimum fluidization velocity Umf. Below Umf, we found local fluidization and gas bubbling in areas adjacent to an inserted horizontal tube, likely caused by the gas locally exceeding Umf as it flows around the insert. Above Umf, the presence of the insert in the bed affected the fluidization dynamics. The wake region above the insert exhibited a lower average particle velocity and reduced velocity fluctuations as well as a substantially reduced number and size of gas bubbles as compared to a reference bed without internals. The extent of this wake region was found to be approximately as wide as the insert, and it extended from the top of the insert to the free surface of the bed. Moreover, the presence of internals also affected the regions below the insert by showing an increased rate of bubble formation directly below the inserted tube. The present work can provide relevant information on the design of fluidized beds with internals. Moreover, the data gathered in this work can be used to validate the accuracy of 3D numerical models of gas-solid systems.},

Using this method, we evaluated four kinds of powder flows transported using different shaped screws in a screw feeder unit. The following results were obtained from this investigation: (i) Increasing the pitch width of the screw yielded decreased transport velocity and a larger diffusion coefficient. (ii) Double screw provided the largest transport velocity and the smallest diffusion coefficient.

  abstract = {In the vitriˆcation of high-level radioactive liquid wastes, platinum group particles originally included in the liquid wastes are mixed into molted glass and convected with the glass ‰ow in vitriˆcation melters. Though behaviors of the platinum group particles in the melters should be investigated to establish e‹cient melter operation methods, di‹culties in observations or measurements of the particles in the actual melters due to high radioactivity have prevented enough investigation. In this paper, we present a numerical analysis method to evaluate the behaviors of the particles in the melters. Since the thermal convectionˆeldconvectionˆeld of the molten glass, electrical potential and particle distribution are formed by the interaction of the particles in the melters, we coupled these physical behaviors in the numerical method to evaluate the melter status with high accuracy. A numerical simulation was conducted and transient behaviors of the particles in the melters were determined. The results of simulation for ten batches of operation (each batch consists of melting, bottom heating and discharging operations) showed that an e{\v{S}}ective particle discharge can be achieved, as observed in mock-up experiments. These results imply that our numerical method can evaluate transient behaviors of the platinum group particles in vitriˆcation melters.},

  abstract  = {In collaboration with industry, Idaho National Laboratory is investigating uranium silicide for use in future light water reactor fuels as a more accident resistant alternative to uranium oxide base fuels. Specifically this project was focused on producing uranium silicide (U3Si2) pellets by conventional powder metallurgy with a density greater than 94% of the theoretical density. This work has produced a process to consistently produce pellets with the desired density through careful optimization of the process. Milling of the U3Si2 has been optimized and high phase purity U3Si2 has been successfully produced. Results are presented from sintering studies and microstructural examinations that illustrate the need for a finely ground reproducible particle size distribution in the source powder. The optimized process was used to produce pellets for the Accident Tolerant Fuel-1 irradiation experiment. The average density of these pellets was 11.54 ± 0.06 g/cm3. Additional characterization of the pellets by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction has also been performed. Pellets produced in this work have been encapsulated for irradiation, and irradiation in the Advanced Test Reactor is expected soon.},

  abstract  = {Uranium nitride fuel was selected for previous space power reactors because of its attractive thermal and physical properties; however, all UN fabrication and testing activities were terminated over ten years ago. An accelerated irradiation test, SP-1, was designed to demonstrate the irradiation performance of Nb-1 Zr clad UN fuel pins for the SP-100 program. A carbothermic-reduction/nitriding process was developed to synthesize UN powders. These powders were fabricated into fuel pellets by conventional cold-pressing and sintering. The pellets were loaded into Nb-1 Zr cladding tubes, irradiated in a fast-test reactor, and destructively examined after 0.8 at% burnup. Preliminary postirradiation examination (PIE) results show that the fuel pins behaved as designed. Fuel swelling, fission-gas release, and microstructural data are presented, and suggestions to enhance the reliability of UN fuel pins are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

  abstract  = {The gas distribution between the dilute (bubble) and dense (emulsion) phases of a fluidized bed is studied locally and globally in the bubbling regime for mixtures composed of sand and different weight fractions of biomass (2-16%). The dilute phase has been characterized by analyzing the pressure and voidage signals. A suite of pressure transducers was used to measure pressure fluctuations at different locations along the bed. A reflective optical probe measured local voidage signals and was placed at different radii (0<. r/. R<0.87) at a height of h=175. mm above the distributor plate. The mean voidage of the bed is increased with higher biomass loading, primarily because of dilution of the emulsion phase. Changing the quantity of biomass in the bed does not significantly affect the voidage of the bubble and emulsion phases. The void (bubble) fraction increases at the center of the bed, whereas it decreases and then increases at the wall region with increasing weight fraction of biomass. Higher quantities of biomass reduce the mean bubble size and boost the bubble frequency at the center of the bed. The core-annulus structure of the bed is intensified for mixtures with relatively low quantities of biomass, while increasing the biomass load leads to a more uniform distribution of small bubbles across the bed improving the fluidization quality. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this work, a parametric experimental campaign was carried out alongside the development of a coupled reactor network model which successfully integrates the individually validated sub-models to predict steady-state reactor performance metrics and outputs. The experiments utilized an integrated gasification system consisting of an externally-heated, bench-scale, 4-in., 5 kWth, fluidized bed steam/air blown gasifier fed with woody biomass equipped with a molecular beam mass spectrometer to directly measure tar species. The operating temperature (750–850°C) and air/fuel equivalence ratio (ER = 0–0.157) were independently varied to isolate their effects. Elevating temperature is shown to improve the char gasification rate and reduce tar concentrations. Air strongly impacts the composition of tar, accelerating the conversion of lighter polycyclic-aromatic hydrocarbons into soot precursors, while also improving the overall carbon conversion. {\textcopyright} 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 63: 1543–1565, 2017.},

  abstract  = {A review of different approaches to modeling the coating mass uniformity in fluidized bed and rotating drum (pans) equipment is presented. In order to predict the coefficient of variation (CV) of the coating mass distribution, the models must include the physics of non-uniform particle movement and/or non-uniform spray flux. Descriptive models for the coating process include those based on renewal theory, compartment models with appropriate population balances, and Monte Carlo simulation. These three approaches give reasonable fits to experimental data. However, they require certain model parameters to be adjusted to obtain a good fit with experimental results or, alternatively, parameters must be evaluated using an extensive experimental program. While such models can describe observed results, they generally lack the rigor to make reliable quantitative predictions outside the range for which the parameters were determined or adjusted. Nevertheless, these models are useful for making qualitative predictions about the effects of changing operating parameters. In addition, regardless of the model, they show that the CV changes with the inverse square root of coating time. More rigorous DEM and CFD models are also considered. Most work to date has not focused explicitly on evaluating the coating mass uniformity. However, recent studies show that CV can be evaluated for laboratory scale equipment and that the effects of non-spherical particles, vessel internals, and the formation of liquid bridges due to the application of coating spray can all be modeled. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract  = {The uniformity of coating applied to large particles and tablets in rotating-drum coating devices is of significant interest to the Pharmaceutical Industry, especially when the coating contains active material or provides a sustained release barrier for drug transport in a functional coat. The purpose of this research was to quantify parameters that characterize the movement of tablets through the region where they receive maximum coating. The three parameters of greatest interest are (1) circulation time (tcirc), (2) surface exposure time ($\tau$surf) and (3) surface area of the tablet projected toward the spray source (nozzle) during each pass through the spray zone (Atab). In order to measure these parameters, a digital imaging system was developed and implemented to analyze images of the surface of the tumbling tablet bed in near real-time. The drum rotation rate was varied between 6 and 12rpm, at two different drum fills of 1/8 and 1/4. Three tablet sizes, 6.3, 7.9 and 10.4mm, were used. The circulation time was found to vary from 2.9 to 15.5 s and the surface time from 0.06 to 0.2s. Decreasing trends for circulation and surface times were observed with increasing drum speeds, drum loadings, and tablet size. Atab and surface velocities were also estimated for the movement of tablets through the spray zone in the rotating drum. The axial dispersion coefficient was estimated from random walk theory. It was found to lie in the range of 0.2 x 10-3 for the conditions studied and was found to increase with increasing drum speed. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Kumar2015,
  abstract  = {A multi-scale modeling approach combining the discrete element method (DEM), a compartment model, and a population balance (PB) has been used to predict inter-particle coating variability in a horizontal, rotating drum. In previous studies using compartment models, compartments were devised using a least squares fit to the spray zone residence time per pass (the time particles spend in the spray during a single pass through the spray zone) and the cycle time (the time between successive visits to the spray zone) distributions. In this work, the difficulties associated with measuring these time distributions are highlighted. In particular, the use of time and area thresholds used to eliminate short duration residence time correlations results in significant differences in the time distributions. A new approach that does not require area or time thresholding is used here. A compartment model consisting of a spray zone and active and passive bed zones is proposed based on the motion of the particles in a rotating drum. The parameters for the resulting coupled set of PB equations are estimated by fitting the time varying coating mass variability curve from the first few tens of seconds (35-85. s) of DEM simulation data. The long term coating mass variability (1000. s) is predicted using the PB model and compared with direct measurements from the DEM simulations. Excellent agreement was obtained between the model and DEM simulations with a relative error of less than 5% for the three cases studied. A sensitivity analysis of the parameters on the model predictions shows that the size of the active bed zone and the time scale of the exchange between the active and passive bed zones have a strong influence on the coating variability. The effective time distributions for the PB-generated spray zone residence time per pass and the cycle time were also found to be significantly different than those obtained from DEM using time or area thresholding. This new modeling approach significantly reduces the computational time required to study the particle coating process as compared to only using DEM.},

The results showed that for a given particle size, the fluidizing air velocity was the most important factor affecting the growth kinetics and the stability of the operation. An increase of the relative humidity, depending on the liquid flow rate as well as the air flow rate, favor agglomeration mechanism especially for values greater than 0.4. An increase in the particle initial size leads to an enhancement of the layering mechanism, especially for values greater than 300 $\mu$m. The effect of the interfacial tension is investigated by adding different concentrations of a non-ionic surfactant to the binding solution. The effect of the contact angle is then studied using non-hydrophobic, partly hydrophobic, or totally hydrophobic particles. The growth of agglomerates appears to be favoured when the interfacial tension increases and the contact angle decreases. The viscosity of the solution has less effect than the interfacial parameters. The results show that the dominant forces in the granulation process are the capillary forces. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The aim of this study is to develop a model of a fluidized bed granulator by combining the gas and particle dynamics with a simple model of particle wetting. Based on material tests, the collision behavior of $\gamma$-Al2O3 particles was characterized and incorporated into the contact model. For two different granulator configurations, a bubbling fluidized bed with top-spray injection and a Wurster-coater, wetting of the particle surface is estimated based on the residence time distribution inside a biconical spray zone. The effect of the geometry of the apparatus on the homogeneity of wetting is analyzed in order to understand the performance and specificity of different granulator configurations. Compared to the top-spray granulator, the Wurster-coater has a narrow residence time distribution of the particles in the spray zone, which corresponds to more homogeneous particle wetting. For the Wurster-coater, the effect of process parameters like air flow rate and geometry details like the position of the Wurster tube is studied using the model. A stable circulating fluidization regime is established by keeping the jet velocity above 100m/s and the gap distance between bottom plate and Wurster tube below 15 times the particle diameterBased on a description of the physical material properties, an effective modeling tool for design and scale-up of a fluidized bed spray granulator is obtained.

  abstract  = {Die filling is a critical process step in pharmaceutical tablet manufacturing. Mass and content uniformity of the tablets as well as production throughput depend upon the die filling performance of the formulations. The efficiency of the die filling process is influenced by powder properties, such as flowability, cohesion, particle size and morphology, as well as the process conditions. It is hence important to understand the influence of powder properties on the die filling performance. The purpose of the present study is to identify the critical material attributes that determine the efficiency of die filling. For this purpose, a model rotary die filling system was developed to mimic the die filling process in a typical rotary tablet press. The system consists of a round die table of 500 mm diameter, equipped with a rectangular die. The die table can rotate at an equivalent translational velocity of up to 1.5 m/s. The filling occurs when the die passes through a stationary shoe positioned above the die table. Using this system, die filling behaviours of 7 commonly used pharmaceutical excipients with various material characteristics (e.g. particle size distribution, sphericity and morphology) and flow properties were examined. The efficiency of die filling is evaluated using the concept of critical filling velocity. It was found that the critical filling velocity is strongly dependent on such properties as cohesion, flowability, average particle size and air sensitivity index. In particular, the critical filling velocity increases proportionally as the mean particle size, flow function, air permeability and air sensitivity index increase, while it decreases with the increase of specific energy and cohesion.},

Coarse fraction was made of milled and sieved acetylsalicylic acid, whereas the fine fraction was mannitol. The die filling process was carried out in gravity filling and suction filling. The segregation was assessed through determination of the coarse component concentration using UV–Visible spectrophotometry. The obtained values of concentration, determined for ten units of identical volume inside the die, were used to calculate the segregation index (SI), which was an indicator of uniformity of the powder blend deposited into the die. It was found that high segregation tendency was generally observed during gravity filling at a low velocity, due to the effect of air drag, and during gravity filling at a high velocity, as it was carried out through three consecutive filling steps. The lowest segregation tendency was generally observed during suction filling at a low velocity. The horizontal segregation was mostly observed in the top layers of the die, due to mainly two mechanisms: coarse particles cascading down the heap formed by the powder in the final steps of die filling, which produces higher coarse concentration at the near side of the die, observed at low coarse concentration; or coarse particle cascading down the top surface of the flowing powder stream into the die, which increases the coarse concentration at the far end of the die.},

  abstract  = {In this study, segregation behaviour of binary granular mixtures with the same particle size but different densities during die filling in the presence of air was investigated using a combined discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach, in which the kinematics of particles was modelled using DEM, the motion of air was analysed using CFD and a two-way coupling of the particles and the air was incorporated. The depositions of powder from stationary and moving shoes into the die cavities of different geometries were simulated and the corresponding segregation behaviours were analysed. It has been found that, for die filling from a stationary shoe, the concentration distributions of the heavy and light particles along the die width mainly depend on the initial spatial distribution of the granular mixture in the shoe. For die filling from a moving shoe, a low concentration of light particles on the leading side of the die (referring to the direction of the shoe motion) is observed for die filling with a square die, in which the process is dominated by nose flow. The density difference can cause segregation along the die depth with a low concentration of light particles at the bottom. The presence of air enhances this segregation tendency by resisting the flow of light particles into the bottom of the die and causes a higher concentration of the light particles at the top. Finally, the segregation index, defined as the volume weighted root-mean-square deviation in the content of light particles, was introduced to quantify the degree of segregation in the horizontal and vertical directions. It has been found that the degree of segregation is determined by the presence of air and also the powder flow pattern. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Inertial microfluidics is regarded as a promising approach to facilitate precise, robust and continuous manipulation of particles through inertial focusing of particles in microchannels. Although there is a need to gain rich insights into the focusing dynamics of particles, it has been hardly studied numerically. In this study, the complex focusing dynamics of particles is simulated numerically for multi-particle suspensions in confined microchannels. To this end, we develop a new method that couples the discrete element method (DEM) with the direct numerical simulation (DNS). This method is referred to as the DEM–DNS method. In order to validate the DEM–DNS method, we then investigate complex dependence of particle behaviour on Reynolds number and channel geometries. With good agreement between the numerical results and existing observations, it is shown for the first time that the DEM–DNS method can simulate the counterintuitive focusing dynamics of particles. This study thus establishes that the DEM–DNS method is a powerful tool to examine the focusing dynamics of particles in inertial microfluidics.},

  abstract  = {The flow and segregation behaviours of the binary mixtures with different particle sizes during die filling in air and in a vacuum were investigated using a coupled discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in three dimensions (3D). Two types of computational setups were considered: i) a fully 3D model with real wall boundaries and ii) a thin sliced model with a slice of the full domain using two parallel periodic boundaries. Die filling with a stationary shoe and a moving shoe were simulated. It was found that the flow and segregation results obtained using the fully 3D and thin sliced models were essentially identical, implying that the thin sliced model can be used to simulate the die filling with a reduced computational time and good accuracy. It was also observed that, for die filling with a stationary shoe, the powder flow rate was reduced by the entrapped air in the die. For the die filling in a vacuum, vertical segregation occurred with a high concentration of fine particles at the bottom of the die as the fine particles can sift through the voids between coarse particles. The presence of air reduced the extent of this segregation by suppressing the percolation of fines through the voids. For die filling with a moving shoe, the effect of air on powder flow and segregation behaviours is negligible when the process is dominated by nose flow as considered in this study, since the air can readily escape from the die cavity. Segregation was also induced during die filling with a moving shoe, due to the free surface segregation and the filtration of fines through the voids between the coarse particles. Consequently, a high overall concentration of fines in the die was obtained, while the concentration of fines at the far end of the die was much lower than that at the near end. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {The effects of electrostatic charge on powder flow behaviour during die filling in a vacuum and in air were analysed using a coupled discrete element method and computational fluid dynamics (DEM/CFD) code, in which long range electrostatic interactions were implemented. The present 2D simulations revealed that both electrostatic charge and the presence of air can affect the powder flow behaviour during die filling. It was found that the electrostatic charge inhibited the flow of powders into the die and induced a loose packing structure. At the same filling speed, increasing the electrostatic charge led to a decrease in the fill ratio which quantifies the volumetric occupancy of powder in the die. In addition, increasing the shoe speed caused a further decrease in the fill ratio, which was characterised using the concept of critical filling speed. When the electrostatic charge was low, the air/particle interaction was strong so that a lower critical filling speed was obtained for die filling in air than in a vacuum. With high electrostatic charge, the electrostatic interactions became dominant. Consequently, similar fill ratio and critical filling speed were obtained for die filling in air and in a vacuum. {\textcopyright} 2012 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

  abstract  = {Flowability that quantifies the flow behaviour of powders is an important material attribute for such applications as packing, hopper flow and powder transport. It is also one of the critical material attributes of pharmaceutical formulations for solid dosage forms. It is anticipated that size enlargement via dry/wet granulation will improve the flowability of feed powders, but it is still unclear how significant the flowability can be enhanced. Therefore, in this study, an experimental investigation was performed to explore how dry granulation affects the flowability of pharmaceutical powders, such as microcrystalline cellulose (MCCs), mannitol and lactose. Both as-received powders and binary mixtures were considered. Granules of various sizes were produced using roll compaction followed by ribbon milling, and the flowability of as-received powders and produced granules was characterised using two methods: 1) the critical filling speed measured using a model die filling system and 2) the flow index measured using a Flodex tester. It was shown that the flowability increases as the size of the granules increases for all materials considered. Furthermore, it was found that there is a strong correlation between the critical filling speed and the flow index: the critical filling speed is proportional to the flow index to a power of − 5/2.},

  abstract  = {A new type of beads mill for dispersing nanoparticles into liquids has been developed. The bead mill utilizes centrifugation to separate beads from nanoparticle suspensions and allows for the use of small sized beads (i.e. 15-30 $\mu$m in diameter). The performance of the beads mill in dispersing a suspension of titanium dioxide nanoparticle with 15 nm primary particles was evaluated experimentally. Dynamic light scattering was used to measure titania particle size distributions over time during the milling process, and bead sizes in the 15-100 $\mu$m range were used. It was found that larger beads (50-100 $\mu$m) were not capable of fully dispersing nanoparticles, and particles reagglomerated after long milling times. Smaller beads (15-30 $\mu$m) were capable of dispersing nanoparticles, and a sharp peak around 15 nm in the titania size distribution was visible when smaller beads were used. Because nanoparticle collisions with smaller beads have lower impact energy, it was found by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy that changes in nanoparticle crystallinity and morphology are minimized when smaller beads are used. Furthermore, inductively-coupled plasma spectroscopy was used to determine the level of bead contamination in the nanoparticle suspension during milling, and it was found that smaller beads are less likely to fragment and contaminate nanoparticle suspensions. The new type of beads mill is capable of effectively dispersing nanoparticle suspensions and will be extremely useful in future nanoparticle research. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In this study a metallurgical grade silicon quality was milled in a planetary ball mill and the properties of the powder were investigated as a function of grinding time, grinding bead size (20 mm, 2 mm, 0.25 mm) and rotational speed based on the concepts presented in the stress model. The finest powder was characterized by a d 50 of 0.62 $\mu$m. This powder was produced with the 2 mm grinding beads and 4 h of grinding (i.e. the highest specific energy input to the mill with this bead size). The largest BET specific surface area, the highest concentration of iron contamination and the smallest amount of crystalline silicon phase were characterized in the powder produced using the 0.25 mm grinding beads and 4 h of grinding (i.e. the highest stress number). Aggregates consisting of silicon and iron were formed. An acid wash to reduce the concentration of iron contaminant revealed that silicon did form an amorphous phase as well as the specific surface area increased. With a constant specific energy input to the mill, a reduction in rotational speed (i.e. reduced stress energy) produced similar powder properties with the exception of the particle size distribution.},

  abstract  = {Dry granulation is an agglomeration process used to produce size-enlarged particles (granules), improving the handling properties of powders such as flowability. In this process, powders are compacted using a roll press to produce ribbons, which are milled in granules used further in the tableting process. The granule and tablet properties are influenced by the existence of different designs of the roll compactors, milling systems and the interaction between process parameters and raw material properties. The main objective of this work was to investigate how different roll-compaction conditions and milling process parameters impact on ribbons, granules and tablet properties, highlighting the role of the sealing system (cheek plates and rimmed roll). In this context, two common excipients differing in their mechanical behaviour (MCC and mannitol) are used. The study is based on the analysis of granule size distribution together with the characterization of loss of compactability during die compaction. Results show that the tensile strength of tablets is lower when using granules than when the raw materials are compressed. Moreover, the plastic material (MCC) is more sensitive than the brittle one (mannitol). Regarding the roll-force, it is observed that the higher the roll force, the lower the tensile strength of tablets from granulated material is. These findings are in agreement with the literature. The comparison of sealing systems shows that the rimmed-roll system leads to slightly stronger tablets than the use of cheek plates. In addition, the use of the rimmed-roll system reduces the amount of fines, in particular when high roll force is applied. Overall, it can be concluded that roll-compaction effect is predominant over the milling effect on the production of fines but less significant on the tablet properties. This study points out that the balance between a good flowability by reducing the amount of fines and appropriate tablet strength is achieved with rimmed-roll and the highest roll-force used.},

The S-statistic analysis is able to give an early warning of the undesirable hydrodynamic state where entrainment occurs provided an appropriate reference state is chosen. When a reference state of 10 wt.% moisture was chosen, a statistically similar hydrodynamic state was identified by the S-statistic occurring 8-9 min prior to the onset of entrainment, thus providing an early warning of this change. The monitoring of bed temperature alone provides no such early warning that entrainment is imminent.

  abstract  = {In this work, a hybrid (phenomenological/ANN-PSO) model has been developed to simulate the spouted bed drying of deformable solid materials, considering material shrinkage and the physical property variation during drying. Accordingly, an artificial neural network (ANN) model has been coupled to a phenomenological one to describe the heat and mass transfer during the drying of these materials, specifically of guava pieces, in a spouted bed dryer. The optimum architecture of ANN (4–7-3) has been obtained using a Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm. This model demonstrated higher accuracy in its ability to estimate the material physical properties (R2 = 0.99, MSE = 0.00048 and RMSE = 0.069). Furthermore, a comparison between the model results and experimental data provided high correlation. This differs from the usual approach, which neglects variation of the physical properties; the hybrid model is able to simulate the drying deformable particle process behaviour considering the transient variation of the properties obtained from the ANN-PSO model. The results differ significantly from those predicted with the assumption of constant properties.},

Spouting behavior of black pepper was studied, and the minimum spouting velocity was determined. The effect of operational conditions; drying temperature, air velocity and stagnant bed height on drying kinetics was analysed. The higher values of drying rates were achieved when the dryer was operated with moderately high temperatures, high airflow rates and shallow beds. The results show an increase in effective moisture diffusivity with increasing drying temperature. The highest effective moisture diffusivity of 2.03 × 10-10 m2/s was obtained at a hot air temperature of 75 °C. Extraction and analysis of essential oil from dried black pepper showed that the variation of oil yield with drying temperature is significant for drying temperatures from 45 °C to 75 °C 65 °C was selected as the best drying temperature for black pepper drying in the conventional spouted bed dryer.},

  abstract  = {The effect of water blanching treatment and the inlet air temperature on drying kinetics as well as the quality attributes of carrot cubes dried in a spout-fluidized bed dryer at 60, 70, 80, and 90°C were analyzed. The material shrinkage and the rehydration potential were calculated to assess the changes in quality of dried carrots. It was found that the value of the air velocity during the drying of carrot cubes in a spout-fluidized bed dryer should be related to the moisture content of the carrot particles. A high value of air velocity at the beginning of the drying cycle and a lower value for the later stages were also required. The linear equation was correlated to the data of shrinkage of raw and blanched carrots. Blanching significantly influenced the coefficients in the shrinkage model derived for drying of carrot cubes in a spout-fluidized bed dryer, while drying temperature did not influence the shrinkage of carrot particles. The intensity of heat and mass transfer during spout-fluidized drying of carrot cubes was dependent on the drying temperature. A correlation was developed to calculate the values of effective moisture diffusivity of dried carrot cubes as a function of the moisture content and temperature of the material. It was observed that for any given time of rehydration, both the moisture content and the rehydration ratio calculated for samples dried at 60°C were higher than for samples dried at temperatures of 60, 70, 80, and 90°C.},

  abstract  = {The coating and granulation of solid particles in a fluidized bed is a process which converts pumpable and atomizable liquids (solutions, slurries, melts) into granular solids in one step by means of drying. The solution to be processed is sprayed onto a fluidized bed. Particle growth can take place either via surface layering or agglomeration. In the case of surface layering the atomized droplets deposit a thin layer of liquid onto the seed particles. The solvent is then evaporated by the hot fluidizing, leaving behind the dissolved material on the surface. Although fluidized bed spray granulation and film coating have been applied in industry for several years, there is still a lack of understanding of the physical fundamentals and the mechanisms by which spherical granules are formed. Hence a new method was developed which allows the direct observation of the subsequent particle-forming mechanisms such as droplet deposition, spreading, wetting and drying. The authors present a laboratory scale apparatus in which a single freely suspended particle can be coated under well defined and constant coating and drying conditions. With this device, particle-growth-rate and the development of particle morphology were measured and investigated under various experimental conditions. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.},

  abstract  = {This paper investigates the use of impeller work combined with an understanding of the significance of the impeller power inflection point during granulation to monitor, control, and scale up high shear wet granulation processes in the pharmaceutical industry. High shear wet granulations were carried out in a series of PMA Fielder granulators (25, 65, 150, and 300-L) with a geometric similar bowl at conditions of constant water addition time and constant tip speed. The results suggested that the granulation process can be effectively scaled up using a linear relationship between the impeller power inflection point (percent of water added at the point where the impeller load starts rising) and the Froude number in PMA Fielder granulator. To close the gap in the series scale up of wet granulation processes, it is desirable to design a granulator at small scale that performs similarly to a full scale commercial granulator such that no variables have to be significantly changed during scale up. A customized 6-L granulator (Fluid Air, Inc.) was designed with a similar bowl geometry as the 300-L Fielder granulator with a specialized blade of lower angle. It is illustrated in this paper that a 6-L granulator can be directly scaled up to a 300-L granulator using constant tip speed and percentage water addition, with the same impeller work and drug product performance. Granulation scale up using the impeller power as the endpoint measurement, combined with a proper impeller blade design can significantly reduce expenditure and time and accelerate the progression of drug product to market, by eliminating stepwise series scale up, and minimizing drug substance requirements. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {Process optimisation and optimal control of batch and continuous drum granulation processes are studied in this paper. The main focus of the current research has been: (i) construction of optimisation and control relevant, population balance models through the incorporation of moisture content, drum rotation rate and bed depth into the coalescence kernels; (ii) investigation of optimal operational conditions using constrained optimisation techniques; (iii) development of optimal control algorithms based on discretized population balance equations; and (iv) comprehensive simulation studies on optimal control of both batch and continuous granulation processes. The objective of steady state optimisation is to minimise the recycle rate with minimum cost for continuous processes. It has been identified that the drum rotation-rate, bed depth (material charge), and moisture content of solids are practical decision (design) parameters for system optimisation. The objective for the optimal control of batch granulation processes is to maximize the mass of product-sized particles with minimum time and binder consumption. The objective for the optimal control of the continuous process is to drive the process from one steady state to another in a minimum time with minimum binder consumption, which is also known as the state-driving problem. It has been known for some time that the binder spray-rate is the most effective control (manipulative) variable. Although other possible manipulative variables, such as feed flow-rate and additional powder flow-rate have been investigated in the complete research project, only the single input problem with the binder spray rate as the manipulative variable is addressed in the paper to demonstrate the methodology. It can be shown from simulation results that the proposed models are suitable for control and optimisation studies, and the optimisation algorithms connected with either steady state or dynamic models are successful for the determination of optimal operational conditions and dynamic trajectories with good convergence properties. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract  = {The use of native starch as in situ binder in a continuous twin screw wet granulation process was studied. Gelatinization of pea starch occurred in the barrel of the granulator using a poorly soluble excipient (anhydrous dicalcium phosphate), but the degree of gelatinization depended on the liquid-to-solid ratio, the granule heating and the screw configuration. Furthermore, the degree of starch gelatinization was correlated with the granule quality: higher binder efficiency was observed in runs where starch was more gelatinized. SEM and PLOM images showed experimental runs which resulted in completely gelatinized starch. Other starch types (maize, potato and wheat starch) could also be gelatinized when processed above a critical barrel temperature for gelatinization. This barrel temperature was different for all starches. In situ starch gelatinization was also investigated in combination with a highly soluble excipient (mannitol). The lower granule friability observed using pure mannitol compared to a mannitol/starch mixture indicated that starch did not contribute to the binding, hence starch did not gelatinize during processing. The study showed that native starch can be considered as a promising in situ binder for continuous twin screw wet granulation of a poorly soluble formulation.},

While homogenous liquid distribution can be achieved by using a spray nozzle, the effect of different nozzle aperture sizes on granule properties is not well understood. In this study, nozzles of different aperture sizes were used to introduce the granulating liquid in high shear wet granulation using different process parameters. Design of experiment approach was utilised to assess effect of process parameters on granule properties. Granules produced with different spray nozzles were evaluated for binder distribution inhomogeneity, size, shape, flowability and compression attributes such as tabletability and yield pressure. Coarser granules with better flow properties were produced using the smaller aperture size nozzle. On the other hand, granules had better tabletability and lower yield pressure when larger aperture size nozzle was used. Furthermore, size of granules produced by using larger aperture size nozzle was more affected by changes in the process variables which could be influenced by the differences in granulating liquid feed rate and spray droplet size. Although the granules aspect ratios were comparable across the nozzle aperture sizes, granules produced from smaller aperture size nozzle appeared to be rounder. Regardless of the nozzle aperture sizes, homogenous binder distribution was achieved. The findings from this study could be a useful guide to the selection of the appropriate nozzle aperture size in wet granulation.},

Granule size and liquid content are considered as internal coordinates, while axial length of granulator is considered as external coordinate. Two types of initial liquid distribution are considered for the model development, i.e. constant and linear distributions. The main focus is on modeling and validation of liquid content distribution of granules. Regime-separated approach was used in order to capture the non-homogeneity of the granulator. The plug flow regime is considered for the conveying zone, while well-mixed regime is assumed for the kneading zone of twin-screw granulator. Aggregation and breakage are considered as the main mechanisms for granule formation and size control. Cell average method is used for solution of the PBM based on lumped parameter approach. In order to determine experimentally the distribution of liquid, liquid binder by dye addition was used in the process. The model findings are calibrated and validated by comparing with measured liquid content in each size fraction. The measured data is collected on a 12 mm twin-screw wet granulator using microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and water soluble dye plus water as binder. The model indicated to be valid for MCC and needs to be validated with further excipients. The results revealed that increasing screw speed led to more uniform liquid distribution. Finally, the model findings indicated that 2D PBM is capable of predicting liquid distribution, and can be used as predictive tool in pharmaceutical continuous granulation.},

As a result, granular behaviour in rotating drums has attracted numerous research efforts from both engineering and physics communities over the past few decades. Most of these studies have been focused on drums operated in or close to the rolling mode. However, there are many industrial cases where drums are operated in other modes, e.g. the cascading and cataracting modes, which forms the main motivation for this work. Comprehensive experiments have been carried out to investigate granular behaviour in a drum operated over a wide range of rotational speed with solids motion across the rolling, cascading and cataracting modes. A digital recording device was used to capture images of the transverse plane of the material bed. Analyses of the images were carried out to extract the bed behaviour as a function of rotational speed, drum fill level and particle size. This has led to three relationships between the surface shape expressed in terms of three characteristic lengths, operating conditions, as well as the friction properties of both particles and drum wall. These relations are found to apply approximately to the whole range of rotational speed used in this work. The generality of these relationships and possible application of them for drum scaling are discussed.},

This work numerically investigated heat transfer inside a drum mixer by coupling the discrete element method (DEM) with a conductive heat transfer model. The mixer was fitted with different types of lifters and rotated at various speeds so their effects on heat transfer characterised by heat transfer coefficient (HTC) could be investigated. The simulation results showed that the specific HTC of the particle flow increased with increasing rotating speed but decreased with the number and height of the lifters. While all types of lifters sped up heat transfer, the straight lifers were more efficient than the arc shape lifters. To better understand the mechanisms of heat transfer, the specific HTC was linked to the particle-wall contact area and dynamic behaviour of particles. The change of lifter configuration, i.e. lifter height, number and shape, mainly affected the particle-wall contact area while the change of mixer rotating speed affected particle mixing behaviour.},

  abstract  = {The mixing behavior of particles in a rotating drum mixer (RDM) was analyzed by experiment and Distinct Element Method (DEM) simulation in order to discuss the effect of particle density. In both of the experiment and the DEM simulation, mixing behavior of alumina (3600 kg/m3) and stainless steel (7930 kg/m3) particles in the rotating drum was observed and mixing degree was evaluated. In the experiment, most of the alumina particles with lower density exist close to the container wall and in the vicinity of the surface of particle bed. The mixing behavior of DEM simulation is comparatively similar to that of the experiment, and it is confirmed that the DEM simulation has high reliability for simulating the mixing behavior. The DEM simulation was used to analyze the influence of particle density on mixing behavior and to make clear the segregation mechanism in a binary system. When the particle density ratio is larger, the mixing behavior in a rotating drum is strongly affected by the ratio. In order to analyze the mechanism of the segregation quantitatively, the new index related with the mobility of particles was developed. This result of the index indicated that the particles with lower density could move easily in comparison with higher density particles, and the difference between the mobility of those materials cause the segregation. The rotating drum with lifters (RDM-L) was adopted to improve the mixing state of particles, and particles behavior in the drum was simulated by the DEM. The mixing state of particles becomes comparatively uniform and the particle segregation would not be observed. These results indicate that lifters could control the behavior of higher and lower density particles and enhance particles mixing.},

  abstract  = {We describe a simulation of granular flow in an industrial ribbon mixer. Such simulations are important to analyze mixing efficiency but they have not been conducted previously in a ribbon mixer, owing to complex boundary conditions. The simulations in this study use the discrete element method (DEM) with a wall boundary model based on a signed distance function (SDF). Introduction of the SDF allows for an accurate representation of the boundary, which is important for proper analysis of granular flow in the ribbon mixer. The adequacy of the DEM/SDF approach was validated qualitatively and quantitatively. The degree of mixing in the ribbon mixer was evaluated using a binary mixture mixing index. The effects of the amount of powder, blade speed and initial loading on the degree of mixing were investigated numerically. In the ribbon mixer, the change of mixing state in the axial direction was found to be much smaller than in the perpendicular direction and an increase in the amount of powder and the blade speed generate better mixing. Only the initial loading and amount of powder were found to be critical for good mixing in the ribbon mixer. The mixing mechanism was investigated by DEM/SDF and an optimal initial loading and amount of powder were suggested for better solid mixing.},

The optimization was made taking into account mixing power and homogenization time for ribbon impellers with a different number of ribbons and width operating in a laminar motion for Newtonian fluid. Due to minimum mixing energy required to stir a unit volume of liquid the most efficient impeller appeared to be that with one ribbon of width equal to 0.1 to 0.15 of the mixing vessel diameter. Impellers with more than one ribbon needed much higher mixing power but did not increase significantly secondary circulation in the vessel.

  abstract  = {Simulations based on Discrete Element Method3 (DEM) are carried out to investigate the effect of blade-supporting spokes of the impeller on overall mixing performance in a ribbon mixer. The influences of some key variables are studied, which include spoke number, particle cohesiveness and fill-level. The overall mixing performance is mainly assessed using the Lacey's mixing index based on the coordination number. The axial velocity variation, axial diffusion coefficient, and contact forces are also analysed to depict the effect of spokes on the mixing. It is found that for non-cohesive particles, increasing the number of spokes is favourable for achieving faster overall mixing when the fill level is large. But this comes at the expense of increased contact forces. It is also found that particle dispersion due to axial velocity fluctuations plays a major role in mixing of non-cohesive particles, but not the axial diffusion. For cohesive particles, no-spokes impeller shows the best overall mixing performance. The effect of spokes on the overall mixing performance is complex and depends on the fill level. At higher fill-levels, the mixing curves are relatively less affected by the number of spokes, while at lower fill-levels, mixing is delayed extensively for 2 and 6 spokes impellers, but the 4-spokes impeller shows some recovery of mixing performance towards that of no-spoke impeller. At low fill-levels, axial diffusion is a governing factor of the mixer performance. Conversely, at high fill-levels, particle dispersion due to the velocity fluctuations become the dominant mixing mechanism for all types of impellers considered. Generally, adding spokes to impellers causes only a slight increase in the contact forces between particles when mixing cohesive particles but a very significant increase in the contact forces when mixing non-cohesive particles. The results indicate that the attached parts in the impeller should be optimized under different operational conditions, which can be guided by DEM simulations.},

The results were successfully validated experimentally using Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) and direct torque measurements. The study determined that the height of the mixer is a key factor in the performance of the mixer, with other significant factors present, but with a lower impact. For the case of torque, all design features of the mixer which increase the size, i.e., surface area acting against motion, were found to be significant in increasing the modelled torque response. The Auger screw was found to have no significant impact on either mixing and torque response. The results illustrate the capability of optimisation algorithms to achieve results comparable to those achieved experimentally, while assessing a significantly larger number of design options and optimising for several performance indicators simultaneously.},

A finite-volume method based on a second-order accurate central-difference scheme is used in conjunction with a two-step fractional-step procedure. The key aspects that need to be considered in developing such a solver are imposition of boundary conditions on the immersed boundaries and accurate discretization of the governing equation in cells that are cut by these boundaries. A new interpolation procedure is presented which allows systematic development of a spatial discretization scheme that preserves the second-order spatial accuracy of the underlying solver. The presence of immersed boundaries alters the conditioning of the linear operators and this can slow down the iterative solution of these equations. The convergence is accelerated by using a preconditioned conjugate gradient method where the preconditioner takes advantage of the structured nature of the underlying mesh. The accuracy and fidelity of the solver is validated by simulating a number of canonical flows and the ability of the solver to simulate flows with very complicated immersed boundaries is demonstrated. {\textcopyright} 1999 Academic Press.},

  abstract  = {Peskin's Immersed Boundary Method has been widely used for simulating many fluid mechanics and biology problems. One of the essential components of the method is the usage of certain discrete delta functions to deal with singular forces along one or several interfaces in the fluid domain. However, the Immersed Boundary Method is known to be first-order accurate and usually smears out the solutions. In this paper, we propose an immersed interface method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with singular forces along one or several interfaces in the solution domain. The new method is based on a second-order projection method with modifications only at grid points near or on the interface. From the derivation of the new method, we expect fully second-order accuracy for the velocity and nearly second-order accuracy for the pressure in the maximum norm including those grid points near or on the interface. This has been confirmed in our numerical experiments. Furthermore, the computed solutions are sharp across the interface. Nontrivial numerical results are provided and compared with the Immersed Boundary Method. Meanwhile, a new version of the Immersed Boundary Method using the level set representation of the interface is also proposed in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

When combined with anisotropic mesh adaptivity, it is possible to resolve complex geometries starting with an arbitrary coarse mesh. The approach is validated by comparing simulation results with available data in three test cases. In the first we simulate the flow past a cylinder. The second test case compares the pressure drop in flow through random packs of spheres with the Ergun equation. In the last case simulation results are compared with experimental data on the flow past a simplified vehicle model (Ahmed body) at high Reynolds number using large-eddy simulation (LES).

  abstract  = {While the discrete element method (DEM) is attracting increasing interest for the simulation of industrial granular flow, much of the previous DEM modelling has considered two-dimensional (2D) flows and used circular particles. The inclusion of particle shape into DEM models is very important and allows many flow features, particularly in hoppers, to be more accurately reproduced than was possible when using only circular particles. Elongated particles are shown here to produce flow rates up to 30% lower than for circular particles and give flow patterns that are quite different. The yielding of the particle microstructure resembles more the tearing of a continuum solid, with large-scale quasi-stable voids being formed and large groups of particles moving together. The flow becomes increasingly concentrated in a relatively narrow funnel above the hopper opening. This encourages the hope that DEM may be able to predict important problems such as bridging and rat-holing. Increasing the blockiness or angularity of the particles is also shown to increase resistance to flow and reduces the flow rates by up to 28%, but without having perceptible effect on the nature of the flow. We also describe our methodology for constructing and modelling geometrically complex industrial applications in three dimensions and present a series of industrially important three-dimensional (3D) case studies. The charge motion in a 5 m diameter ball mill and in a Hicom nutating mill, discharge from single- and four-port cylindrical hoppers, and particle size separation by a vibrating screen are demonstrated. For each case, plausible particle size distributions (PSDs) have been used. The results obtained indicate that DEM modelling is now sufficiently advanced that it can make useful contributions to process optimisation and equipment design. Finally the parallelisation of such a DEM code is described and benchmark performance results for a large-scale 2D hopper flow are presented. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The contact criterion was developed directly by solving the intersection equations, and the contact forces were calculated according to elastic-plastic and Mindlin models. It was shown that the seeds may perform translational and rotational motion in a 3D space after the impact. With the influences of particle shape, orientation and angle of incidence, three typical impact processes were found: single impact, multiple impacts in a short-time, and continuous impacts. Two important parameters for the design of loss sensors are the maximum normal impact force Fn max and the force rise-time tr. Simulations showed that an increase in particle ellipticity strongly enlarged the differences in Fn max. As the ellipticities increased from unity to 2, the defined force ratio $\eta$ decreased from 100% to about 40%, and this value decreased to less than 20% when ellipticities continuously increased from 2 to 4. Tangential velocity led to an asymmetric variation of $\eta$. tr was generally distributed between 12 and 54$\mu$s. In laboratory tests, rice seeds were allowed to free fall onto a loss sensor from a height of 320mm. Results indicated that the peak output voltage was fluctuated in 1.5-4.5V, and the rise-time was in 14-48$\mu$s. {\textcopyright} 2013 IAgrE.},

Contact force and gravity force were considered when establishing the model. In addition, the velocity distribution and voidage variance of corn-shaped and spherical particles were investigated. The results show that the vertical velocity difference between centre and side wall and the horizontal velocity of corn-shaped particles are relatively larger than that of spherical particles. The mean voidage for corn-shaped particles is smaller than for spherical particles in any hopper. And the mean voidage values decrease with the increase of the ratio of width and length (D/L) and the ratio of height and width (H/D) for both corn-shaped and spherical particles. The local voidage profiles in hoppers with different D/L were also studied. It demonstrates that the wall effect on the voidage of spherical particles is more remarkable than that of the corn-shaped particles. The voidage fluctuations of corn-shaped and spherical particles decrease obviously with increasing D/L when the particles are far away from the wall.

The motion of individual particles is modeled by DEM, and the gas motion is modeled by the k- $\epsilon$ two equation turbulent model. The mixing quality is described by the Lacey mixing index, it is evaluated in terms of the mixing degree at the mixing equilibrium and the time required reaching the steady value. The state of mixing of uniform particles is studied by analyzing the effect of particle shape, density and spouting gas velocity. For binary systems, the effects of component shape and size are examined. The results show that spouting gas velocity and particle properties are important parameters influencing particle mixing quality in spouted bed. The mixing quality is found to be sensitive to particle shape, the spheres mix faster and more homogeneous than corns. In monocomponent corn system, the mixing quality increases with increasing of gas velocity and decrease with increasing particle density, and it is sensitive to particle shapes, the spheres mix faster and more homogeneous than corns. In binary corn-sphere system, particles with closer sizes and operated at higher gas velocity have better mixing quality. Besides, the mixing mechanism of corn-shaped particles is discussed based on the mixing process of monocomponent and binary systems. It is found that particles of different shapes, sizes and densities can have different trajectories in the fountain region, leads to a different radial landing position on the top of the annulus, and the subsequent path through the annulus region varies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {Three dimensionally coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discrete element method (DEM) were used to investigate the flow of corn-shaped particles in a cylindrical spouted bed with a conical base. The particle motion was modeled by the DEM, and the gas motion by the k-$\epsilon$ two-equation turbulent model. A two-way coupling numerical iterative scheme was used to incorporate the effects of gas-particle interactions in terms of momentum exchange. The corn-shaped particles were constructed by a multi-sphere method. Drag force, contact force, Saffman lift force, Magnus lift force, and gravitational force acting on each individual particle were considered in establishing the mathematical modeling. Calculations were carried out in a cylindrical spouted bed with an inside diameter of 200 mm, a height of 700 mm, and a conical base of 60°. Comparison of simulations with experiments showed the availability of the multi-sphere method in simulating spouting action with corn-shaped particles, but it depended strongly on the number and the arrangement of the spherical elements. Gas-solid flow patterns, pressure drop, particle velocity and particle concentration at various spouting gas velocity were discussed. The results showed that particle velocity reaches a maximum at the axis and then decreases gradually along the radial direction in the whole bed. Particle concentration increases along the radial direction in the spout region but decreases in the fountain region, while it is nearly constant in the annulus region. Increasing spouting gas velocity leads to larger pressure drop, remarkably increased speed of particle moving upward or downward, but decreased particle concentration. {\textcopyright} 2012 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a numerical study of the packing of nonspherical particles by the use of the discrete element method. The shapes considered are oblate and prolate spheroids, with the aspect ratio varying from 0.1 to 7.0. It is shown that the predicted relationship between packing fraction and aspect ratio is consistent with those reported in the literature. Ellipsoids can pack more densely than spheres. The maximum packing fraction occurs at an aspect ratio of 0.6 for oblate spheroids, and 1.80 for prolate spheroids. The packing characteristics with aspect ratio are further analyzed in terms of structural parameters such as coordination number and radial distribution function. It is shown that ellipsoids with small or large aspect ratios tend to give a locally ordered structure. The results demonstrate that DEM provides a useful method to investigate the packing dynamics of ellipsoidal particles.},

In most methods, polygons are used to represent a rigid body configuration. In this paper a novel particle based method is presented and some examples are calculated. A simple algorithm for collision detection is proposed using particles and Distinct Element Method (DEM) is used for collision response. In the case that a configuration of a rigid body is complicated, the quantity of data is reduced and the calculation is fast. It is also easy to couple with fluid motion using Moving Particle Semi-implicit (MPS) method.},

@article{Khawaja2012,
  abstract  = {CFD-DEM (Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Modelling) is a two-phase flow numerical modelling technique, where the Eulerian method is used for the fluid and the Lagrangian method for the particles. The two phases are coupled by a fluid-particle interaction force (i.e. drag force) which is computed using a correlation. In a two-phase flow, one critical parameter is the voidage (or void fraction), which is defined as the ratio of the volume occupied by the fluid to the total volume. In a CFD-DEM simulation the local voidage is computed by calculating the volume of particles in a given fluid cell. For spherical particles, this computation is difficult when a particle is on the boundary of fluid cells. In this case, it is usual to compute the volume of a particle in a fluid cell approximately. One such approximation divides the volume of a particle into each cell in the same ratio as an equivalent cube of width equal to the particle diameter. Whilst this approach is computationally straight forward, the approximation introduces an error in the voidage computation. Here we estimate the error by comparing the approximate volume calculation with an exact (numerical) computation of the volume of a particle in a fluid cell. The results show that the error varies with the position of the particle relative to the cell boundary. A new approach is suggested which limits the error to less than 2.5 {\%}, without significantly increasing the computational complexity.},

Because the orientation of the body is usually random, it is the distribution function for the projected area which is of interest. In order to assist in the interpretation of light diffraction measurements and image analysis, the distribution of the projected area for (tri-axial) ellipsoids and general cylinders is derived. The graph of the distribution is given for an ellipsoid with axes in the ratio 1:2:8.

For the monodisperse systems, 35 different combinations of the Reynolds number Re (up to Re = 1,000) and packing fraction $\phi$ were studied, whereas for the bidisperse systems we also varied the diameter ratio (from 1:1.5 to 1:4) and composition, which brings the total number of different systems that we considered to 150. For monodisperse systems, the data was found to be markedly different from the Ergun equation and consistent with a correlation, based on similar type of simulations up to Re = 120. For bidisperse systems, it was found that the correction of the monodisperse drag force for bidispersity, which was derived for the limit Re = 0, also applies for higher-Reynolds numbers. On the basis of the data, a new drag law is suggested for general polydisperse systems, which is on average within 10{\%} of the simulation data for Reynolds numbers up to 1,000, and diameter ratios up to 1:4. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.},

  abstract = {Capillary forces are commonly encountered in nature because of the spontaneous condensation of liquid from surrounding vapor, leading to the formation of a liquid bridge. In most cases, the advent of capillary forces by condensation leads to undesirable events such as an increase in the strength of granules, which leads to flow problems and/or caking of powder samples. The prediction and control of the magnitude of capillary forces is necessary for eliminating or minimizing these undesirable events. The capillary force as a function of the separation distance, for a liquid bridge with a fixed volume in a sphere/plate geometry, was calculated using different expressions reported previously. These relationships were developed earlier, either on the basis of the total energy of two solid surfaces interacting through the liquid and the ambient vapor or by direct calculation of the force as a result of the differential gas pressure across the liquid bridge. It is shown that the results obtained using these methodologies (total energy or differential pressure) agree, confirming that a total-energy-based approach is applicable, despite the thermodynamic nonequilibrium conditions of a fixed volume bridge rupture process. On the basis of the formulas for the capillary force between a sphere and a plane surface, equations for the calculation of the capillary force between two spheres are derived in this study. Experimental measurements using an atomic force microscope (AFM) validate the formulas developed. The most common approach for transforming interaction force or energy from that of sphere/plate geometry to that of sphere/sphere geometry is the Derjaguin approximation. However, a comparison of the theoretical formulas derived in this study for the interaction of two spheres with those for sphere/plate geometry shows that the Derjaguin approximation is only valid at zero separation distance. This study attempts to explain the inapplicability of the Derjaguin approximation at larger separation distances. In particular, the area of a liquid bridge changes with the separation distance, H, and thereby does not permit the application of the "integral method," as used in the Derjaguin approximation.},

  abstract  = {We numerically investigated liquid droplet impact behavior onto a dry and flat surface. The numerical method consists of a coupled level set and volume-of-fluid framework, volume/surface integrated average based multimoment method, and a continuum surface force model. The numerical simulation reproduces the experimentally observed droplet behavior quantitatively, in both the spreading and receding phases, only when we use a dynamic contact angle model based on experimental observations. If we use a sensible simplified dynamic contact angle model, the predicted time dependence of droplet behavior is poorly reproduced. The result shows that precise dynamic contact angle modeling plays an important role in the modeling of droplet impact behavior. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract  = {An understanding of dynamic wetting is necessary when considering processes in which one fluid is forced to displace another fluid from a solid substrate. This work examines the forced wetting behavior exhibited by a series of solid-liquid systems in the low capillary number regime. In particular, the effects of specific chemical (i.e. acid-base) interactions between the liquid and the solid and of solid surface roughness on dynamic wetting are investigated. Measurement of the dynamic contact angle as a function of the interline velocity is performed using the technique of microtensiometry. The data are compared with empirical correlations in order to test the hypothesis that a universal correlation may be used to describe wetting behavior. The results suggest that two correlation having the same functional form but different constants are necessary to adequately describe wetting behavior above and below a capillary number of the order of 10-3. No significant differences are observed between the wetting behavior of systems with only dispersive interactions between the liquid and solid and systems with acid-base interactions, implying that the static contact angle adequately accounts for the effect of acid-base interactions. Surface roughness produces noticeable stick-slip effects in the low capillary number regime when the static contact angle is larger than approximately 15°. While these effects produce a large degree of scatter in the dynamic wetting measurements, they do not alter the constants from those found in the case of smooth interline motion. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

This relation leads to others governing the variation of drop size and slope with time. The predictions are compared with experiment, using silicone oils, and good agreement obtained. The lubrication approximation theory gives no solution for thicknesses below a value varying from 2 to 9*10-8 m at the drop edge.

Computations with both static and dynamic contact angles are adopted to assess the importance and implications of the modeling aspect. Both water and ink droplets are considered, with direct experimental visualization and quantitative measurement employed to assess the computation. The effects of wettability, viscosity, surface tension, and impact velocity on the droplet spreading and recoiling behavior and wall heat transfer are assessed. It is found that the drop inertia directly influences the spread characteristics, the surface tension plays a major role in the recoil frequency, the drop viscosity damps out the drop spread and recoil, and the contact angle affects both the spreading and recoiling processes. Overall, the dynamic contact angle model attenuates the recoiling of the drop. The wall heat flux distribution is clearly affected by the drop dynamics. Larger spreading results in a wider area of heat exchange. High heat flux rates take place at the early stage of impingement and decays in time. {\textcopyright} 2003, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.

The model accounts for the effects of discontinuities such as density and viscosity jumps and singular sources such as surface tension in both bubble and droplet simulations. With a level-set representation of the propagating interface, large deformations of the boundary can be handled easily. The model successfully captures the essential features of interactions between fluid-fluid and solid-fluid phases during impact and spreading. Moving contact lines are modeled with contact angle hysteresis and contact line motion on non-planar surfaces is computed. Experimental observations and other simulation results are used to validate the calculations. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The general procedure for solution is described for a general model for such slip and also for a general geometry of the system. Using matched asymptotic expansions, it is shown that for small capillary number and for small values of the length over which slip occurs, there are either 2 or 3 regions of expansion necessary depending on the limiting process being considered. For the very important situation where 3 regions occur, solutions are obtained from which it is observed that in general there is a maximum value of the capillary number for which the solutions exist.

  abstract = {Many numerical models for flows of immiscible fluids bounded by topologically complex interfaces possessing surface tension are based on an Eulerian formulation of the equations of motion. In these models the location of the interface is usually represented by a scalar function f , sometimes referred to as a color function, that varies monotonically from one constant value to another through the interface. This transition region is a thin band along the interface within which surface tension forces are applied in continuum surface tension (CST) models. The function f can be regarded as a numerical approximation to the characteristic function associated with the interface. Although widely used, many CST models do not accurately approximate interface topology such as unit normal and mean curvature. These inaccuracies arise because of difficulties in approximating the spatial derivatives of the function f in the transition region. Accurate representations of the Dirac delta function are also needed to formulate the force due to surface tension in the transition region. Here we study the role of convolving the funciton f with a smooth, radially-symmetric kernel to improve estimates to the interface topology. In particular, we introduce a new kernel that results in a better estimation to the spatial derivatives of f and present a hybrid convolution-finite difference technique to estimate interface curvatures. Our CST algorithm generates better than second-order accurate approximations to the curvature of circular and spherical interfaces. It also mitigates the numerically-induced "parasitic currents' in computations of a spherical drop in static equilibrium.},

Second-order temporal accuracy is achieved by virtue of a multidimensional unsplit time integration scheme. We detail our geometrically based solution method, in which material volume fluxes are computed systematically with a set of simple geometric tasks. We then interrogate the method by testing its ability to track interfaces through large, controlled topology changes, whereby an initially simple interface configuration is subjected to vortical flows.

(3) The one-dimensional surface approximations for a mixed fluid cell are completely determined by testing whether or not the various fluids in the mixed cell are present or absent in the zone just to the left and to the right in the coordinate direction under consideration. (4) Because of the completely one-dimensional nature of the SLIC interface description, it is relatively easy to advance the fluid surfaces correctly in time. With the SLIC fluid-surface definitions, it should be possible to incorporate any one space dimensional method for advancing contact discontinuities. This makes SLIC very practical for the numerical solution of fluid dynamical problems.},

The paper describes the improvement of the reconstruction when a least-square fit algorithm, which minimizes a distance functional, is applied. Its performance is tested for several smooth surfaces against other simple reconstruction methods. Then Eulerian, Lagrangian and mixed split advection schemes are presented and analyzed. In particular, one advection method is discussed that conserves mass exactly for a divergence-free velocity field, thus allowing computations to machine precision. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In the original THINC scheme, one-dimensional THINC scheme was straightforwardly used for multi-dimensional cases. In this paper, we propose the WLIC (weighed line interface calculation) method to extend the THINC scheme to multi-dimension. In the WLIC method, the interface is reconstructed by taking an average of line interfaces along x, y and z coordinates with the weights calculated from surface normal. The WLIC method can extend the THINC scheme to multi-dimension while maintaining simplicity of implementation and achieve a higher accuracy than the original THINC scheme. The WLIC method can readily extend the THINC scheme to three-dimension. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {We derive local volume-averaged single-field conservation equations, called the VA-VOF equations, for a two-phase system consisting of two immiscible incompressible components. These equations are suitable for numerical simulations of dynamic interface evolutions with the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method, where the boundary layer at the interface is not fully resolved by the grid. As compared to the local equations currently used within the customary VOF-method, the newly derived mass and momentum conservation equations contain additional terms, which depend on the local phase-space-averaged relative velocity. For very fine grids, this relative velocity vanishes and the local form of the VOF equations is recovered. The additional terms in the VA-VOF equations are discussed and shown to render the VA-VOF equations incomplete. To close the VA-VOF equations, a local uniform relative velocity (LURV) model is presented. For a benchmark problem depicting a two-dimensional circular interface between two liquids in static equilibrium, the LURV-model is shown to reduce appreciably the negative effects of the spurious currents that numerically distort the interface.},

The algorithm is here applied in conjunction with a finite-volume technique employing a backward temporal difference scheme to the computation of compressible and incompressible flow cases. The results of calculations are compared with similar ones obtained with an existing iterative method. It is shown that for time-evolving flows the splitting error of PISO is negligibly small at the level of time-step required to eliminate the temporal truncation error, while the avoidance of iteration results in a substantial reduction in computing effort over that required by iterative methods. It is also demonstrated that PISO is stable for fairly large time steps, which renders it useful for steady-state calculations as well. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

The model was developed based on the discrete element method (DEM) with the inter-particle cohesive interaction due to liquid bridging. To take into account the liquid bridge force between particles and between a particle and a wall, a regression expression for the liquid bridge force was developed as a function of the dimensionless liquid bridge volume and the separation distance based on numerical solutions of the Laplace-Young equation. The critical rupture distance, i.e. the maximum separation distance where the liquid bridges rupture between particles or between a particle and a wall, was also correlated in the similar manner. For gas motion the Anderson-Jackson local averaged Navier-Stokes equations were integrated by the SIMPLE method employing the staggered grid system. For the particle motion the Newtonian equations of motion of individual particles were integrated, where the Hooke's repulsive and damping forces for particle collission, the gravity force, the drag force and the particle cohesion force were taken into account. Example computations were conducted for a two-dimensional bed of spherical particles of 1 mm in diameter, density of 2650kg/m3, moisture content of 0.27 wt{\%} and gas velocity of 1.2 m/s. Both dry and wet powder behavior in a fluidized bed was successfully reproduced. It was observed that such a wet powder was fluidized forming agglomerates. The fluctuations of the pressure drop and the minimum fluidizing velocity for wet powder were higher than those for dry particles in the present computer experiment. The granular temperature was obtained from particle velocity. The high granular temperature area below a rising bubble and above a forming bubble could he found for both dry and wet particles.},

  abstract  = {A three-roll mill is used in various engineering fields to manufacture high-value-added products. This mill has three horizontally positioned rolls with different rotational velocities. In the mill, viscous materials (or pastes) pass through the narrow gap between the rolls to be mixed, refined, dispersed, and/or homogenized. The viscous materials tend to consist of wet-particles connected by liquid bridges. Although viscous materials always adhere to a faster roll in the three-roll mill, the mechanism has not yet been clarified. Herein, the adhesion mechanism is clarified scientifically by numerical simulation. In the calculations, a Lagrangian method, such as the discrete element method, is used to analyze the specific phenomena in the particle-particle and the particle-wall interaction. A latest liquid bridge force model is used in this study to examine the effect of a wide range of liquid volumes on the adhesion phenomena. In the calculation, a lump of wet-particles is fed into the gap between the two rolls and the roll speed is changed to investigate its influence on the adhesion phenomena. Through numerical examples, it is proven that wet-particles always adhere to a fast roll because the liquid bridge force that acts on the faster roll is larger than that on the slower roll after the compression force is released. This is because the extension of the wet-particles is larger on the faster roll because of the speed difference between the two rolls. Consequently, the adhesion mechanism of the wet-particles in the three-roll mill is proven scientifically to be the force balance due to the liquid bridge force.},

Numerical simulation is a promising approach for the design and investigation of operational conditions. In previous studies, an Eulerian-Lagrangian coupling method was developed for solid-liquid flows. However, it is difficult to apply this method to moving boundary problems because of the excessive calculation costs due to adaptive mesh or sliding mesh. To solve the difficulty, a Lagrangian-Lagrangian coupling method has been developed, which couples the Discrete Element Method (DEM) for the solid phase and the Moving Particle Semi-Implicit (MPS) method for the fluid phase. It can successfully calculate solid-fluid flows and has been validated, although it has been applied only to two-dimensional systems. In the present study, we develop a three-dimensional DEM-MPS method and apply it to bead mill systems, and show the effectiveness of the method. The simulation results, namely, the solid particle distribution and velocity are compared with experimental results and we thus demonstrate the validity of the method. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {The objective of this paper is to identify a numerical method to simulate motion of a packed or fluidized bed of fuel particles in combustion chambers, such as a grate furnace and a rotary kiln. Therefore, the various numerical methods applied in the areas of granular matter and molecular dynamics were reviewed extensively. As a result, a time driven approach was found to be suited for the numerical simulation of particle motion in combustion chambers. Furthermore, this method can also be employed to moving boundaries which are required for the present application e.g. travelling grate. The method works in a Lagrangian frame of reference, which uses the position and orientation of particles as independent variables. These are obtained by time integration of the three-dimensional dynamics equations derived from the classical Newtonian approach for each particle. This includes the keeping track of all forces and momentums acting on each particle at every time step. Viscoelastic contact forces include normal and tangential components with viscoelastic models for energy dissipation and friction. The particle shapes are approximated by spheres and ellipsoids with a varying size and ratio of the semi-axis accounting for the variety of particle geometries in a combustion chamber. For these shapes the overlap of particles during contact is expressed by a polynomial of 4th order in the two-dimensional case and a polynomial of 6th order in the three-dimensional case. A new algorithm to detect two-dimensional elliptical particle contact with sufficient accuracy was developed. It is based on a sequence of coordinate transformations and has demonstrated its reliability in numerous applications. Finally, the method was applied to simulate the motion of spherical and elliptical particles in a rectangular enclosure, on a travelling grate, and in a rotary kiln.},

  abstract  = {The combination of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Discrete Element Model (DEM) is a powerful tool for studying fluidized particulate systems and granular flows. In DEM, the individual interaction forces between particles are treated on a particle–particle pair basis, and therefore, this method is computational expensive. In addition, the CFD-calculation of the fluid flow increases the computational effort. Thus, current CFD–DEM simulations are limited to systems with particle numbers not exceeding 105. In order to simulate realistic systems, the recently available Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) technology can be applied, which can perform massively-parallel DEM-simulations with several million particles on a single desk-side Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The objective of this work is to present a new hybrid approach to solve CFD–DEM problems in gas–solid fluidized beds systems applying an efficient coupling method suitable for large-scale simulations. We are using the CUDA technology for the particle simulation and introducing a coupling methodology with a commercial CFD-code. The coupling method between a CFD-code, running on the CPU and our CUDA-based DEM-code running on the GPU, is introduced and discussed. The numerical results are compared to the CFD–DEM and the experimental results of Van Buijtenen et al. (2011). A good agreement was achieved. Finally, fluidized system simulations with up to 25 million particles are presented, which is an unprecented number.},

  abstract  = {Numerical modeling of solid-liquid flows involving free surface and fluid-particles interactions is of great importance for chemical engineering. In this article, the DEM-MPS method for the simulation of complex two-dimensional solid-liquid flows proposed by Sakai et al. (2012) has been evolved to perform fully-resolved three-dimensional Lagrangian-Lagrangian simulations. As in the previous work, the discrete element method (DEM) and the moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) method were coupled via the local averaging technique. In this study, new discretization schemes are proposed to improve the accuracy and stability of the DEM-MPS method. Furthermore, the explicit pressure calculation is introduced to close the model instead of the previous semi-implicit algorithm, which largely reduces the computational cost in three-dimensional cases. The resulting numerical method is simple and efficient, and able to treat free surfaces and moving boundaries with ease. As for fundamental principles of multiphase hydrodynamics, the present formulation can naturally deal with water displacement of solid particles. Focusing on the macroscopic behavior of granular flows, a comparison of simulation results obtained for the solid-liquid mixture in a revolving cylindrical tank with experimental reference data is carried out, from which good agreements have been confirmed concerning the width and height of the solid bed. By further referring to the solution yielded by the previous two-dimensional model, the present DEM-MPS method seems to better reproduce the bed shape in a quasi-steady state. Hence, the validation tests show the adequacy and suitability of the present DEM-MPS method for three-dimensional simulation of solid-liquid flows involving free surfaces. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {Particle science and technology is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary research area with its core being the understanding of the relationships between micro- and macroscopic properties of particulate/granular matter-a state of matter that is widely encountered but poorly understood. The macroscopic behaviour of particulate matter is controlled by the interactions between individual particles as well as interactions with surrounding fluids. Understanding the microscopic mechanisms in terms of these interaction forces is therefore key to leading to truly interdisciplinary research into particulate matter and producing results that can be generally used. This aim can be effectively achieved via particle scale research based on detailed microdynamic information such as the forces acting on and trajectories of individual particles in a considered system. In recent years, such research has been rapidly developed worldwide, mainly as a result of the rapid development of discrete particle simulation technique and computer technology. This paper reviews the work in this area with special reference to the discrete element method and associated theoretical developments. It covers three important aspects: models for the calculation of the particle-particle and particle-fluid interaction forces, coupling of discrete element method with computational fluid dynamics to describe particle-fluid flow, and the theories for linking discrete to continuum modelling. Needs for future development are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This original DDA formulation calculated the shear force at each contact by considering the incremental displacement of the shear contact spring. Other approaches that model particulate materials discretely generally use the cumulative spring displacement at each contact to calculate the shear contact force. The modifications required to implement a cumulative spring formulation in DDA are presented. A simple, single disk validation example demonstrates the improved performance of the modified algorithm. An analysis of a biaxial compression test highlights the sensitivity of the response of disk assemblies to the shear spring formulation.},

  abstract  = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract  = {This book is devoted to the Discrete Element Method (DEM) technique, a discontinuum modelling approach that takes into account the fact that granular materials are composed of discrete particles which interact with each other at the microscale level. This numerical simulation technique can be used both for dispersed systems in which the particle-particle interactions are collisional and compact systems of particles with multiple enduring contacts. The book provides an extensive and detailed explanation of the theoretical background of DEM. Contact mechanics theories for elastic, elastic-plastic, adhesive elastic and adhesive elastic-plastic particle-particle interactions are presented. Other contact force models are also discussed, including corrections to some of these models as described in the literature, and important areas of further research are identified. A key issue in DEM simulations is whether or not a code can reliably simulate the simplest of systems, namely the single particle oblique impact with a wall. This is discussed using the output obtained from the contact force models described earlier, which are compared for elastic and inelastic collisions. In addition, further insight is provided for the impact of adhesive particles. The author then moves on to provide the results of selected DEM applications to agglomerate impacts, fluidised beds and quasi-static deformation, demonstrating that the DEM technique can be used (i) to mimic experiments, (ii) explore parameter sweeps, including limiting values, or (iii) identify new, previously unknown, phenomena at the microscale. In the DEM applications the emphasis is on discovering new information that enhances our rational understanding of particle systems, which may be more significant than developing a new continuum model that encompasses all microstructural aspects, which would most likely prove too complicated for practical implementation. The book will be of interest to academic and industrial researchers working in particle technology/process engineering and geomechanics, both experimentalists and theoreticians.},

  abstract = {There are three main frameworks to describe the orientation and rotation of non-spherical particles: Euler angles, rotation matrices and unit Quaternions. Of these methods, the latter seems the most attractive for describing the behaviour of non-spherical particles. However, there are a number of drawbacks when using unit Quaternions: the necessity of applying rotation matrices in conjunction to facilitate the transformation from body space to world space, and the algorithm integrating the Quaternion should inherently conserve the length of the Quaternion. Both drawbacks are addressed in this paper. The present paper derives a new framework to transform vectors and tensors by unit Quaternions, and the requirement of explicitly using rotation matrices is removed altogether. This means that the algorithm derived in this paper can describe the rotation of a non-spherical particle with four parameters only. Moreover, this paper introduces a novel corrector-predictor method to integrate unit Quaternions, which inherently conserves the length of the Quaternion. The novel framework and method are compared to a number of other methods put forward in the literature. All the integration methods are discussed, scrutinised and compared to each other by comparing the results of four test cases, involving a single falling particle, nine falling and interacting particles, a 2D prescribed torque on a sphere and a 3D prescribed torque on a non-spherical particle. Moreover, a convergence study is presented, comparing the rate of convergence of the various methods. All the test cases show a significant improvement of the new framework put forward in this paper over existing algorithms. Moreover, the new method requires less computational memory and fewer operations, due to the complete omission of the rotation matrix in the algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

The method is validated by comparing force vector plots obtained from the computer program BALL with the corresponding plots obtained from a photoelastic analysis. The photoelastic analysis used for the comparison is the one applied to an assembly of discs by De Josselin de Jong and Verruijt (1969). The force vector diagrams obtained numerically closely resemble those obtained photoelastically. It is concluded from this comparison that the distinct element method and the program BALL are valid tools for research into the behaviour of granular assemblies. {\textcopyright} 1979, Thomas Telford Ltd.

  abstract  = {Large-scale gas-solid flow systems, e.g., fluidized beds, cyclone separators and pneumatic conveyors, are often encountered in chemical engineering. Numerical modeling technologies are widely applied for design and understanding of complex phenomena in these gas-solid flow systems, for which the coupled model of the discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics is generally employed. However, application of the numerical simulations for these systems is still limited because the number of the particles that can be modeled (about several hundreds of thousand) is quite small comparing with the immeasurable number of particles used in the industrial processes, and not sufficient to fully understand the complex behavior in these processes. The coarse graining DEM is then developed to provide an alternative approach for modeling the real industrial processes. Accuracy of the coarse graining DEM has been proven for simple systems so far. In the present study, applicability of the coarse graining DEM for complex shaped domains is explored, for which typical industrial processes, such as fluidization with inserted tubes, and powder flow into a confined space, are considered. In these calculations, signed distance functions (SDF) and immersed boundary method (IBM) are used to model an arbitrary shape wall boundary in a gas-solid flow. Both numerical modeling using the coarse graining DEM and experimental investigation are performed with a thorough comparison between the experimental and numerical results. It is demonstrated that the coarse graining DEM is capable of accurately modeling of industrial gas-solid two-phase systems. Besides, this numerical approach is shown to provide valuable information such as pressure profile during powder injection and interaction between bubbles and structures in a fluidized bed.},

The liquid-bridge force is introduced to the discrete element method in the investigation of the behavior of wet particles. However, existing numerical modeling has problems from the viewpoint of the effect of cohesion in contact states. Specifically, the cohesive force is treated as a constant value for contact states. This means the effect of the cohesive force is not only dependent on the spring constant in the discrete element simulation but is also frequently overestimated. To solve this problem, the present study developed a numerical contact model considering quantitatively the effect of the cohesive force in contact states and validated the model for a pan pelletizer. The behaviors and cascading angles of wet particles in simulation and experiments were in good agreement and the validity of the contact model was thus demonstrated. The present numerical contact model is thus a promising model for the numerical simulation of wet particles.},

There is a desire in industry to apply a numerical technology to design of an actual powder process. In the present study, the discrete element method (DEM) was applied to a twin-screw kneader as an example of an actual industrial blender, and the mixing efficiency was investigated for different operational parameters. The complexly shaped wall boundaries of the paddles and vessel were created using the signed distance function (SDF). Validation tests were first performed to demonstrate the applicability of the DEM employing the SDF-based wall boundary model. In the validation tests, simulations and experiments were shown to be in quantitative agreement in terms of the spatial distribution of solid particles. The mixing efficiency was then investigated for different rotational speeds and amounts of powder, where the degree of mixing was evaluated using Lacey's mixing index. The numerical simulation could clarify the mixing mechanism behind observed phenomena. The study thus illustrated that the total amount of powder affected the mixing efficiency of the twin-screw kneader.},

  abstract  = {Die filling is an important manufacturing process that is widely involved in material science and technology in chemical engineering. Application of numerical technologies is desired in optimizing a die filling process. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is widely used to simulate granular flows in die filling. However, the existing DEM has a problem regarding the computation of air flow in a moving shoe system, even though the DEM is coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This is because that the simulation of a gas-solid flow with a moving boundary requires an extremely complex algorithm. In order to solve this problem, The Advanced DEM-CFD method is proposed to calculate granular particles interacting with air meanwhile during the whole die filling process. In the Advanced DEM-CFD method, a compact algorithm is employed to simulate a gas-solid flow in a moving boundary system, where wall boundary is modeled by Signed Distance Function and Immersed Boundary Method for solid phase and fluid phase. Validation tests are performed to show the adequacy of the Advanced DEM-CFD method. The results show that the simulations well agree with the experiments, and hence our numerical approach is adequate to reproduce actual die filling processes.},

  abstract = {In this study, a numerical method is developed to perform the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of gas-solid-liquid flows involving capillary effects. The volume-of-fluid method employed to track the free surface and the immersed boundary method is adopted for the fluid-particle coupling in three-phase flows. This numerical method is able to fully resolve the hydrodynamic force and capillary force as well as the particle motions arising from complicated gas-solid-liquid interactions. We present its application to liquid bridges among spherical particles in this paper. By using the DNS method, we obtain the static bridge force as a function of the liquid volume, contact angle, and separation distance. The results from the DNS are compared with theoretical equations and other solutions to examine its validity and suitability for modeling capillary bridges. Particularly, the nontrivial liquid bridges formed in triangular and tetrahedral particle clusters are calculated and some preliminary results are reported. We also perform dynamic simulations of liquid bridge ruptures subject to axial stretching and particle motions driven by liquid bridge action, for which accurate predictions are obtained with respect to the critical rupture distance and the equilibrium particle position, respectively. As shown through the simulations, the strength of the present method is the ability to predict the liquid bridge problem under general conditions, from which models of liquid bridge actions may be constructed without limitations. Therefore, it is believed that this DNS method can be a useful tool to improve the understanding and modeling of liquid bridges formed in complex gas-solid-liquid flows.},

Subsequently, correlation between solid mixing and macroscopic behavior of the solid particles is examined in the present study. The macroscopic properties such as solid-particle spatial distribution, pressure drop and velocity distribution of the solid phase are confirmed to correspond quantitatively in the coarse-grain model and an original particle system. Finally, the calculation efficiency of the coarse-grain model is evaluated. Consequently, the coarse-grain model is shown to be able to efficiently investigate the solid mixing in a spouted bed.},

Although there is a need to gain rich insights into the focusing dynamics of particles, it has been hardly studied numerically. In this study, the complex focusing dynamics of particles is simulated numerically for multi-particle suspensions in confined microchannels. To this end, we develop a new method that couples the discrete element method (DEM) with the direct numerical simulation (DNS). This method is referred to as the DEM–DNS method. In order to validate the DEM–DNS method, we then investigate complex dependence of particle behaviour on Reynolds number and channel geometries. With good agreement between the numerical results and existing observations, it is shown for the first time that the DEM–DNS method can simulate the counterintuitive focusing dynamics of particles. This study thus establishes that the DEM–DNS method is a powerful tool to examine the focusing dynamics of particles in inertial microfluidics.},

A major challenge in implementing ellipsoidal element to DEM is the development of an efficient and stable contact detection algorithm in order to properly detect contact formation and compute contact forces on the elements. In view of the current available methods in two‐dimensional (2D) condition, two different contact detection algorithms for ellipsoidal particles in 3D modelling are identified. Their accuracy and efficiency are compared and the results favour the algorithm based on the geometric potential concept.

  abstract  = {In powder handling processes treating wet powders (e.g. wet granulation, coating, and drying), a liquid bridge formed between particles is not static but dynamic due to continuous motion of the particles. Therefore, understanding of a particle-particle adhesion by such a dynamic liquid bridge is an important issue. We here conducted a numerical simulation of the particle-particle adhesion by the dynamic pendular liquid bridge. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach with a constrained interpolation profile (CIP) method was applied to simulate a gas-liquid two phase flow, while a particle motion was calculated by taking into account the dynamic liquid bridge. To verify the simulation results, the following verifications were conducted; (i) wetting behavior of a droplet on a curved surface, (ii) static liquid bridge force between two particles, and (iii) rupture behavior of a liquid bridge with free falling of a particle. As a result, validity of the simulation results was confirmed. The particle-particle adhesion through a droplet on a particle surface was then simulated. In particular, effect of a collision velocity on a wet restitution coefficient was investigated. A velocity criterion for the particle adhesion was determined from the simulation results and compared with that estimated from an analytical model proposed by Ennis et al (1991).},

Previous work on the necessary condition for the stability of such bridges is examined and the minimum free-energy formulation applicable to any contact angle is proven. It is shown that this formulation is a more fundamental criterion for specifying the stable numerical solutions of the Laplace-Young equation, although equivalent to previous conjectures based on the liquid bridge neck diameter and filling angle. At relatively low contact angles, say {\textless}40°, the critical separation for rupture is given by the cube root of the liquid bridge volume to a good approximation. The toroidal approximation provides a simple method of estimating the total liquid bridge force. The {\textless}gorge method{\textgreater} of evaluation leads to errors of {\textless}10{\%} for all stable separations and a wide range of bridge volumes. The accuracy is independent of contact angle because of geometrical self-similarity. Simple scaling coefficients can be introduced into the toroidal approximation to allow force estimations to be made with relatively high accuracy. {\textcopyright} 1993 by Academic Press, Inc.},

The discussion focuses on the effects of mesoscale behavior, especially those present in process industries for materials and energy transformation and utilization. When there is substantial multiscale heterogeneity in these systems, local non-equilibrium and anisotropy generally lead to a lack of scale separation. Accurate and efficient simulation methods based on first principles and applied across different scales are highly desirable to reveal and quantify the complexities of these systems. Meanwhile, precisely designed experiments and exhaustive nonintrusive measurements are necessary to validate and expand the numerical findings. With this knowledge, rational mesoscale models can be established to provide multiscale simulation methods that do not need to fully reproduce the micro- and mesoscale details of the systems but can still take into account their effects on macroscales. Such multiscale methods are attractive for industrial applications but substantial effort in physical modeling and numerical implementation is still required before their widespread implementation.},

One advantage of this method is that the plane equation need not be computed on the fly nor be stored, which can amount to significant memory savings for triangle meshes.

Inspired by these two conventional methods, we propose a Contact Force Prediction Method that makes a larger time step possible. Our method uses the predicted values of contact force at every contact point, which are exact solutions or numerical solutions of differential equations that represent two particle contacts. It has been confirmed experimentally that the proposed method gives reasonable results of packing and discharge simulations, and accelerates DEM calculation 3-8 times.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation of charge motion in ball, semi-autogenous (SAG) and autogenous mills has advanced to a stage where the effects of lifter design, power draft and product size can be evaluated with sufficient accuracy using either two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) codes. While 2D codes may provide a reasonable profile of charge distribution in the mill there is a difference in power estimations as the anisotropic nature within the mill cannot be neglected. Thus 3D codes are preferred as they can provide a more accurate estimation of power draw and charge distribution. While 2D codes complete a typical industrial simulation in the order of hours, 3D codes require computing times in the order of days to weeks on a typical multi-threaded desktop computer. A newly developed and recently introduced 3D DEM simulation environment is BLAZE-DEM that utilizes the Graphical Processor Unit (GPU) via the NVIDIA CUDA programming model. Utilizing the parallelism of the GPU a 3D simulation of an industrial mill with four million particles takes 1 h to simulate one second (20 FPS) on a GTX 880 laptop GPU. This new performance level may allow 3D simulations to become a routine task for mill designers and researchers. This paper makes two notable extensions to the BLAZE-DEM environment. Firstly, the sphere-face contact is extended to include a GPU efficient sphere-edge contact strategy. Secondly, the world representation is extended by an efficient representation of convex geometrical primitives that can be combined to form non-convex world boundaries that drastically enhances the efficiency of particle world contact. In addition to these extensions this paper verifies and validates our GPU code by comparing charge profiles and power draw obtained using the CPU based code Millsoft and pilot scale experiments. Finally, we conclude with plant scale mill simulations.},

This study numerically simulates the shear-induced deformation of spherical aggregates of particles with close-packed and hollowed-out structures to evaluate its rheological effects on the bulk suspension. Simulations are performed by the discrete element method (DEM) coupled with direct numerical simulation (DNS), herein referred to as the “DEM–DNS method.” This method can be used to simultaneously evaluate adhesive force and contact force acting on particles, which play an essential role in aggregate breakup, combined with the two-way particle–fluid interaction. The simulations show that the weakly sheared suspensions for both aggregates, subjected to no structural rearrangement, yield the same shear viscosity. In contrast, under strong shear where both aggregates undergo an irreversible breakup, the suspension of the hollow aggregate shows greater shear thinning than that of the close-packed aggregate. This bifurcation in shear thinning suggests the mechanism underlying the oft-encountered large shear thinning: the shear-induced breakup of aggregates enables a release of the fluid caged inside the aggregates and thus a substantial decrease in the apparent volume fraction of the solid phase. We thereby demonstrate the sophisticated capacity of the DEM–DNS method for experimentally unachievable correlation of shear-induced deformation of aggregates with a macroscopic viscosity evaluation.},

Both the gas and the particle properties are scaled in this method, and a detailed comparison among alternative mapping strategies is performed by scaling both the computational grid size and the riser depth. A series of CFD-DEM simulations has been performed for a pseudo-2D CFB riser to enable a detailed comparison with experimental data. By applying the scaling method, the hydrodynamic flow behavior could be well predicted and cluster characteristics, such as cluster velocity and cluster holdups agreed well with the experimental data. For a full validation of the scaling method, four mapping conditions with different ratios of the grid size and particle volume and of modified ratio of riser depth to particle size were analyzed. The results show that in addition to hydrodynamic scaling of the particle and fluid properties, scaling of the dimensions for the interphase mapping is also necessary.},

  abstract = {Long-time behaviors widely exist in gas–solid reactors, e.g., the coke deposition and catalyst deactivation in the methanol to olefins (MTO) process. Due to the limitation of the computational cost, previous simulations of MTO reactors were mainly conducted with two-fluid model at short-time scales and assumed that the catalyst are perfectly mixed. Efficient simulation methods are, therefore, highly desirable, even for evaluating the assumptions through very long-time investigation. In this study, the MTO reaction kinetics is incorporated into a coarse-grained discrete particle method, namely EMMS-DPM, to simulate a pilot-scale reactor for 8 h of physical time. The simulation is validated by comparing the obtained gaseous products and coke contents with the experimental data. The perfect mixing assumption is validated by observing the residence time distribution of the catalyst for the whole reactor. The detailed coke content could provide more accurate data for accelerating steady state simulations. Furthermore, the relation between the coke content and age of the catalyst is directly obtained for the first time, which is valuable to effective use of the catalyst before discharging. The coke content is positively correlated to the age, but is also influenced by local conditions. For example, near the distributor, the catalyst particles are not well mixed and the maximum reaction rate fluctuates significantly even at large time scales. Thus, long-time particle-scale simulation would provide more dynamic details to characterize the reaction in the critical regions of the reactor, thus being very helpful to optimize operating conditions and the reactor designs.},

  abstract  = {Application of numerical simulations are desired to improve the quality of powder products and to optimize the production process in powder die-filling. In the powder die-filling, complex gas-solid interaction should be simulated since the solid particles are significantly influenced by the gas flow under moving wall boundary. The discrete element method (DEM) coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been widely utilized in the simulation of gas-solid flows, and the adequacy has been proved through countless studies. On the other hand, the existing DEM-CFD method is extremely difficult to simulate the gas-solid flow where the wall boundary is moving. Besides, in the existing DEM-CFD method, huge number of computational particles cannot be simulated on a single PC. Hence, numerical simulations of the industrial powder die-filling becomes a challenging topic from a viewpoint of evolution of the DEM-CFD method, because modeling of the moving wall boundary as well as modeling of large number of computational particles should be considered simultaneously. Very recently, the authors' group has developed the Integrated DEM-CFD method including the arbitrary shape wall boundary model and the scaling law model. In the Integrated DEM-CFD method, the wall boundary is modeled by the signed distance functions and the immersed boundary method, and besides the coarse graining DEM is employed as the scaling law model. Adequacy of the Integrated DEM-CFD method has been proved through verification tests. In the current study, applicability of the Integrated DEM-CFD method is examined in the powder die-filling. Adequacy of the Integrated DEM-CFD method is shown by agreement between the original particle system and the coarse graining particle system in the powder die-filling. Through the verification tests, macroscopic characteristics of the powder die-filling are shown to be reproduced by the Integrated DEM-CFD method. Consequently, the Integrated DEM-CFD method is illustrated to be effective for the simulation of the industrial powder die-filling systems.},

  abstract  = {The discrete element method (DEM) coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is regarded to be a standard approach in a numerical calculation of gas-solid flow. When the DEM-CFD method is applied to the simulation of industrial systems, we cannot shy away from the modeling of arbitrary shape wall boundaries. Very recently, we have developed an innovative wall boundary model in the DEM-CFD simulations, where the signed distance function (SDF) and the immersed boundary method (IBM) are used for the wall boundary in the DEM and CFD. The SDF makes it possible to create an arbitrary shape wall boundary based on the scalar field. The IBM can be used for the wall boundary model by reflecting the number of the SDF points on the local volume fraction in CFD grid. Thus, the arbitrary shape wall boundary can be easily created in the DEM-CFD method by combining the SDF with the IBM. On the other hand, the authors' group has pointed out the necessity of the density scale technique in CFD. In the density scale technique, the density scale coefficient is considered in the calculation of the pressure Poisson equation. When the SDF/IBM is applied to CFD without density scaling technique, an unnatural fluid flow might occur through the wall boundary object. The effect of the density scaling coefficient on a gas-solid flow has not been examined so far. From this background, the influence of the density scale coefficient on a gas-solid flow is investigated in the present study. Through this study, introduction of the density scaling technique is designated to be crucial when the IBM is used for the wall boundary in the DEM-CFD simulation. The density scaling coefficient is shown to be decided not by theory but by experience, and the value should become 100 to 1000 in a typical gas-solid flow system. Besides, it is illustrated that the calculation cost is not influenced by the value of the density scale coefficient in the DEM-CFD simulations.},

The algorithm is simple to implement and requires minimal pre-processing and additional storage, yet leads to 2-4 times improvement in framerate for views with high degrees of occlusion. Our method is based on the well-known occlusion horizon algorithm. We show how to adapt the algorithm for use with hierarchical terrains. The occlusion horizon is constructed as the terrain is traversed in an approximate front to back ordering. Regions of the terrain are compared to the horizon to determine when they are completely occluded from the viewpoint. Culling these regions leads to significant savings in rendering.},

A fundamental understanding of the influence and interaction of coke and ore particles on the burden topography and packing density is therefore essential, in particular, the influence of particle shape polydispersity and particle size polydispersity. In this paper we analyze the effect of particle shape and size polydispersity on the coke and ore charge distribution inside a bell-less blast furnace using the discrete element method (DEM). We first validate experimentally the polyhedral particle model with a simplified lab-scale charging experiment. A comparative study between spheres, with rolling friction to account for shape, and polyhedra is conducted for shape and size polydisperse particle systems. It was found that shape polydispersity mainly influenced the topography of the burden, whereas the size polydispersity mainly influenced the inter-layer percolation, i.e. localized particle diffusion, hence the local spatial packing density. The differences between the spherical particle models and polyhedral particle models on the burden topography are also quantitatively and qualitatively presented, especially on the role of particle shape on the push-up of coke in the centre. This study demonstrates that modelling particle shape effects using spheres with rolling friction is insufficient to fully describe the complex behaviour of shaped particles in a blast furnace, as the particle shape has a noteworthy influence on the burden characteristics.},

  abstract  = {We report on 3D computer simulations based on the soft-sphere discrete particle model (DPM) of Geldart A particles in a 3D gas-fluidized bed. The effects of particle and gas properties on the fluidization behavior of Geldart A particles are studied, with focus on the predictions of Umf and Umb, which are compared with the classical empirical correlations due to Abrahamsen and Geldart [1980. Powder Technology 26, 35-46]. It is found that the predicted minimum fluidization velocities are consistent with the correlation given by Abrahamsen and Geldart for all cases that we studied. The overshoot of the pressure drop near the minimum fluidization point is shown to be influenced by both particle-wall friction and the interparticle van der Waals forces. A qualitative agreement between the correlation and the simulation data for Umb has been found for different particle-wall friction coefficients, interparticle van der Waals forces, particle densities, particle sizes, and gas densities. For fine particles with a diameter dp{\textless}40$\mu$m, a deviation has been found between the Umb from simulation and the correlation. This may be due to the fact that the interparticle van der Waals forces are not incorporated in the simulations, where it is expected that they play an important role in this size range. The simulation results obtained for different gas viscosities, however, display a different trend when compared with the correlation. We found that with an increasing gas shear viscosity the Umb experiences a minimum point near 2.0×10-5Pas, while in the correlation the minimum bubbling velocity decreases monotonously for increasing $\mu$g. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Some typical features, including the homogeneous expansion, gross particle circulation in the absence of bubbles, and fast bubbles, can be clearly displayed if the interparticle van der Waals forces are relatively weak. An anisotropy of the velocity fluctuation of particles is found in both the homogeneous fluidization regime and the bubbling regime. The homogeneous fluidization is shown to represent a transition phase resulting from the competition of three kinds of basic interactions: the fluid-particle interaction, the particle-particle collisions (and particle-wall collisions) and the interparticle van der Waals forces. In the bubbling regime, however, the effect of the interparticle van der Waals forces vanishes and the fluid-particle interaction becomes the dominant factor determining the fluidization behavior of Geldart A particles.

  abstract = {Dry, frictional, steady-state granular flows down an inclined, rough surface are studied with discrete particle simulations. From this exemplary flow situation, macroscopic fields, consistent with the conservation laws of continuum theory, are obtained from microscopic data by time-averaging and spatial smoothing (coarse-graining). Two distinct coarse-graining length scale ranges are identified, where the fields are almost independent of the smoothing length w. The smaller, sub-particle length scale, w ≪ d, resolves layers in the flow near the base boundary that cause oscillations in the macroscopic fields. The larger, particle length scale, w ≈ d, leads to smooth stress and density fields, but the kinetic stress becomes scale-dependent; however, this scale-dependence can be quantified and removed. The macroscopic fields involve density, velocity, granular temperature, as well as strain-rate, stress, and fabric (structure) tensors. Due to the plane strain flow, each tensor can be expressed in an inherently anisotropic form with only four objective, coordinate frame invariant variables. For example, the stress is decomposed as: (i) the isotropic pressure, (ii) the "anisotropy" of the deviatoric stress, i.e., the ratio of deviatoric stress (norm) and pressure, (iii) the anisotropic stress distribution between the principal directions, and (iv) the orientation of its eigensystem. The strain rate tensor sets the reference system, and each objective stress (and fabric) variable can then be related, via discrete particle simulations, to the inertial number, I. This represents the plane strain special case of a general, local, and objective constitutive model. The resulting model is compared to existing theories and clearly displays small, but significant deviations from more simplified theories in all variables - on both the different length scales. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

  abstract  = {Explicit and closed expressions for the stress and couple-stress fields for discrete (classical) mechanical systems in terms of the constituents' degrees of freedom and interactions are derived and compared to previous results. This is done by using an exact and general coarse graining formulation, which allows one to predetermine the resolution of the continuum fields. Since the full dynamics of the pertinent fields is considered, the results are not restricted to static states or quasi-static deformations; the latter comprise mere limiting cases, which are discussed as well. The fields automatically satisfy the equations of continuum mechanics. An explicit expression for the antisymmetric part of the stress field is presented; the question whether the latter vanishes, much like its nature when it does not, have been debated in the literature. Physical explanations of some of the obtained results are offered; in particular, an interpretation of the expression for the stress field provides an argument in favor of its uniqueness, yet another topic of debate in the literature. The formulation and results are valid for single realizations, and can of course be used in conjunction with ensemble averaging. Part of the paper is devoted to a biased discussion of the notion of coarse graining in general, in order to set the presented results in a certain perspective. Although the results can be applied to molecular (nanoscale included) and granular systems alike, the presentation and some simplifying assumptions (which can be easily relaxed) target granular systems. The results should be useful for the analysis of experimental and numerical findings as well as the development of constitutive relations. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2010.},

  abstract  = {A critical comparison of a hard-sphere discrete particle model, a two-fluid model with kinetic theory closure equations and experiments performed in a pseudo-two-dimensional gas-fluidised bed is made. Bubble patterns, time-averaged particle distributions and bed expansion dynamics measured with a nonintrusive digital image analysis technique are compared to simulation results obtained at three different fluidisation velocities. For both CFD models, the simulated flow fields and granular temperature profiles are compared. The effects of grid refinement, particle-wall interaction, long-term particle contacts, particle rotation and gas-particle drag are studied. The mechanical energy balance for the suspended particles is introduced, and the energy household for both CFD models is compared. The most critical comparison between experiments and model results is given by analysis of the bed expansion dynamics. Though both models predict the right fluidisation regime and trends in bubble sizes and bed expansion, the predicted bed expansion dynamics differ significantly from the experimental results. Alternative gas-particle drag models result in significantly different bed dynamics, but the gap between model and experimental results cannot be closed. In comparison with the experimental results, the discrete particle model gives superior resemblance. The main difference between both CFD models is caused by the neglect of particle rotation in the kinetic theory closure equations embedded in the two-fluid model. Energy balance analysis demonstrates that over 80{\%} of the total energy is dissipated by sliding friction. Introduction of an effective restitution coefficient that incorporates the additional dissipation due to frictional interactions significantly improves the agreement between both models. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

The p- $\epsilon$ algorithm (Van der Hoef et al., 2006) has been implemented to deal with densely packed regions in the fluidized bed. A modified SIMPLE algorithm is used to solve the pressure and volume fraction corrections, and a projection method is used to obtain solutions of the momentum equations. The resulting semi-implicit method allows for using larger time steps and produces accurate results in a stable and efficient manner. Numerical tests on bubbling fluidized beds are undertaken and compared with experimental data reported by Laverman et al., 2012. The simulation results are found to be in good agreement.

To this end, we developed a finite-difference scheme to resolve the flow around each particle moving in turbulence. The method was applied to the flow around a sphere and the accuracy was confirmed up to the Reynolds number range with vortex shedding. The agreement between our 4th-order central finite-difference method and spectral method for turbulent channel flow without particles was also fine. Then, we simulated upward flow in a vertical channel including solid particles. The velocity and vorticity fluctuations as well as Reynolds shear stress were strongly affected by wakes from particles. The shed vortices were elongated in the mainstream direction by the velocity gradient and resulted in the hairpin vortices. They increased the energy production rate in couple with production due to particle-turbulence correlation.},

  abstract  = {In the present study, a comprehensive coarse-grained computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM) is developed for modeling the fluidized bed gasifier. Based on the model validations against experimental measurements, a series of simulations are conducted to investigate the effects of different operating parameters on the coal gasification in a bubbling fluidized bed. This study offers new insights into the effects of gas-solid mixing on the gasification reaction. The results show the non-uniform spatial distributions of the gasification rate in both the horizontal and vertical directions, which reflects the preferential distribution of fuel particles. It is found that the gas back-mixing plays an important role in controlling of the pyrolysis gas combustion, which is undesired for producing gasification products. The results show that the sand particle size has the most remarkable effect on the gas back-mixing. Though the uniformity of the fuel particle distribution is not a key factor influencing the average product yields, the horizontal fuel particle mixing is found to be the main cause of the fluctuations of the gasification rate. Fundamentally, it is demonstrated that the fluctuations of the horizontal fuel mixing are mainly dominated by the bubble behaviors.},

  abstract  = {The discrete element method (DEM) is widely used in calculating powder systems. The DEM makes it possible to determine the complicated phenomena related to particle flowability. However, DEM has a fatal problem, which is that the number of calculated particles is restricted due to excessive calculation costs. Consequently, we have developed a large-scale model of the DEM, which is called the coarse grain model. The coarse grain particle represents a group of the original particles. Therefore, a large-scale DEM simulation can be performed using an extremely small number of the calculated particles. In our previous studies, the coarse grain model was applied in gas-solid and solid-liquid flow systems. It is anticipated that the coarse grain model will be used in various powder systems. In the current study, the coarse grain model has been applied to a two-dimensional bubbling fluidized bed. The adequacy of the coarse grain model was proved by a comparison with the original particle behavior. The simulation results obtained using the coarse grain model showed good agreement with the results for the original system. Moreover, the calculation speed with the coarse grain model was shown to be much faster than the calculation speed of the original model. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {The discrete element method (DEM) is widely used to comprehend complicated phenomena such as gas-solid flows. This is because the DEM enables us to investigate the characteristics of the granular flow at the particle level. The DEM is a Lagrangian approach where each individual particle is calculated based on Newton's second law of motion. However, it is difficult to use the DEM to model industrial powder processes, where over a billion particles are dealt with, because the calculation cost becomes too expensive when the number of particles is huge. To solve this issue, we have developed a coarse grain model to simulate the non-cohesive particle behavior in large-scale powder systems. The coarse grain particle represents a group of original particles. Accordingly, the coarse grain model makes it possible to perform the simulations by using a smaller number of calculated particles than are physically present. As might be expected, handling of fine particles involving cohesive force is often required in industry. In the present study, we evolved the coarse grain model to simulate these fine particles. Numerical simulations were performed to show the adequacy of this model in a fluidized bed, which is a typical gas-solid flow situation. The results obtained from our model and for the original particle systems were compared in terms of the transient change of the bed height and pressure drop. The new model can simulate the original particle behavior accurately. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Society of Powder Technology Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V. and The Society of Powder.},

  abstract  = {In industrial applications, fluidized bed reactors with complex geometry are often used to process non-spherical particles, e.g., the biomass utilization. It is well known that CFD-DEM (Computational Fluid Dynamics/Discrete Element Method) is a powerful tool for studying the fluidization. However, few researchers had ever investigated the fluidization of non-spherical particles in the complex geometry using CFD-DEM. In this study, a robust and efficient CFD-DEM algorithm is correspondingly proposed, in which the non-spherical particles are represented by rod-like particles and are described by the super-ellipsoid model. An approach is incorporated into the CFD-DEM model to detect the contact between the rod-like particles and the complex geometry. The CFD-DEM coupling method has also been modified for the coupling between DEM and CFD with the unstructured mesh. Subsequently, the efficiency of the coupling method of CFD-DEM is tested. To validate the prediction accuracy of the CFD-DEM model, the simulations of the fluidization of rod-like particles in a fluidized bed with a horizontal immersed tube that represents the complex geometry are then compared with the corresponding experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed CFD-DEM model has a rather high efficiency and accuracy for modeling the fluidization of rod-like particles in a fluidized bed with complex geometry.},

The effects of the particle dispersion volume fraction and the pore size on the transmembrane pressure were then investigated. The results show that the transmembrane pressure increases and fluctuates even in the absence of membrane fouling when a particle penetrates the pore.

The finite-volume method uses cut cells at the boundaries rendering the method strictly conservative in terms of mass, momentum, and energy. For three-dimensional compressible flows, such a method has not been presented in the literature, yet. Since ghost cells can be arbitrarily positioned in space the proposed method is flexible in terms of shape and size of embedded boundaries. A key issue for Cartesian grid methods is the discretization at mesh interfaces and boundaries and the specification of boundary conditions. A linear least-squares method is used to reconstruct the cell center gradients in irregular regions of the mesh, which are used to formulate the surface flux. Expressions to impose boundary conditions and to compute the viscous terms on the boundary are derived. The overall discretization is shown to be second-order accurate in L1. The accuracy of the method and the quality of the solutions are demonstrated in several two- and three-dimensional test cases of steady and unsteady flows. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper, we propose an improved method to dynamically correct the effective hydrodynamic diameter by retracting inward the Lagrangian points to varying distances. The retraction distance is determined by querying a function fitted in this paper. The improved method is tested and validated by several cases, including falling of a spherical particle under gravity, the uniform flow past two stationary particles and the drafting-kissing-tumbling phenomenon of two settling particles. It turns out the improved method not only provides better results for the drag force but also predicts the flow field more accurately. What's more, due to the insensitivity to grid resolution, the improved method is suitable for simulating large-scale fluid–particle systems such as fluidized bed, which are computationally expensive.},

However, in the open literature, there lacks the systematic RTD research for BFs. In this study, an integrated mathematical model is developed for describing the gas RTD of a BF. The model combines a steady multi-fluid model for describing the in-furnace state of flow and thermo-chemical behavior of gas-solid-liquid phases and a transient model for describing the dynamic behavior of tracer materials. The results show that the gas flow field inside the BF is quite complex, resulting from many factors such as furnace geometry and coupled thermo-chemical behaviors of other phases. The tail of gas RTD curve resulted from the lagging phenomenon of tracer flow inside BFs, is captured. The gas RTD is discussed by using mean residence time, dispersion of molecules distribution, cumulative distribution function and residence time intensity function. Under the given BF conditions, mean residence time and space time of gas fluids are predicted as 13.5 s and 16.3 s, respectively. The existence of stagnant flow in the BF can be both derived and directly identified. Moreover, it is indicated the gas flow patterns in the BF are composed of piston-type flow, stagnant flow and limited mixing flow. This study provides a cost-effective tool for better understanding BF gas flow dynamics and optimizing BF operations.},

The immersed boundary method (IBM) is a convenient approach to handle fluid-solid interactions with complex geometries. In this work, Uhlmann's direct-forcing IBM is improved and implemented on a supercomputer with CPU-GPU hybrid architecture. The direct-forcing IBM is modified as follows: the Poisson's equation for pressure is solved before evaluation of the body force, and the force is only distributed to the Cartesian grids inside the immersed boundary. A multidirect forcing scheme is used to evaluate the body force. These modifications result in a divergence-free flow field in the fluid domain and the no-slip boundary condition at the immersed boundary simultaneously. This method is implemented in an explicit finite-difference fractional-step scheme, and validated by 2D simulations of lid-driven cavity flow, Couette flow between two concentric cylinders and flow over a circular cylinder. Finally, the method is used to simulate the sedimentation of two circular particles in a channel. The results agree very well with previous experimental and numerical data, and are more accurate than the conventional direct-forcing method, especially in the vicinity of a moving boundary.},

  abstract  = {This paper investigates the landscape of extremum characteristics for different energy consumption terms in gas-solid fluidization based on the Energy Minimization Multi-Scale (EMMS) model. The influence of typical cluster correlations on the extremum characteristics is also investigated to consolidate the results. The energy consumption terms are resolved into three types, i.e. suspension (“s”), transport (“t”) of the particles and pure dissipation (“d”) caused by their collisions and acceleration. Three regimes which are particle-dominated (PD), fluid-dominated (FD), and particle-fluid compromising (PFC) respectively subject to the extrema of $\epsilon$ = min, Wst = min and Nst = min, are investigated. Then the same procedure is extended to individual and combined terms (i.e. “s” “t” “d” “s + t” “t + d” “d + s”) of energy consumption with respect to unit mass of particles (“N”) and to unit volume of bed (“W”). The study of extremum characteristics reveals an enclosure structure which features an upper voidage regime corresponding to minimum energy dissipation rate (MinED), a lower voidage regime to maximum energy dissipation rate (MaxED) and a so-called mesoregime in between. The landscape of extremum characteristics reveals that the stability condition must be constructed according to clear physical meaning, otherwise misleading may occur due to multiple contradictive extrema exist in specific regimes. Although the clustering effects on extremum characteristics exposed some limitations of current correlations, the above-mentioned characteristics are found to be insensitive to cluster diameter correlations, indicating that the findings are intrinsic to the EMMS model. Further work is still needed to explore the mesoscale structure and its relationship with extremum behavior as well as underlying physics in fluidization.},

  abstract  = {Shape is one of the most important properties of particles, and can affect particle flow behavior significantly in particulate systems. In the past, extensive studies have been conducted on the effect of particle size and density on the mixing quality of particle mixtures in gas-fluidized beds, but little is known regarding the influence of particle shape. In this work, CFD-DEM approach is used to investigate the mixing of binary mixtures composed of ellipsoids and spheres. A modified drag model suitable for multicomponent mixtures of non-spherical particles is proposed first, and its validity is then verified by comparison to experimental data. The simulation results show that for the cases considered, adding a second component of ellipsoids to spheres results in reducing the minimum fluidization velocity of the mixtures; however, oblate particles in decreasing the minimum fluidization velocity is more significant than prolate particles. The mixing index of all binary mixtures generally increases with increasing gas superficial velocity. The results also show that with the added component varying from spheres to oblate or prolate particles, segregation happens in the bed and becomes more severe with aspect ratio. It is found that the effect of particle shape on the drag force is responsible for the occurrence of particle segregation.},

  abstract  = {The discrete element method (DEM) coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is regarded as a standard approach for a simulation of a gas-solid mixture system. In the DEM-CFD method, the local volume average technique is employed, and hence the fluid motion is calculated based on the void fraction. Although the accuracy of the DEM-CFD method has been improved through lots of studies, inflexibility may become a problem due to the local volume average technique. Specifically, calculations of a gas-solid flow involving thin walls is substantially impossible even by the improved DEM-CFD method. This is because the thin wall cannot be represented when its thickness becomes as large as one grid size due to usage of the local volume average technique. In order to solve this problem, a flexible discretization technique is newly proposed, where the signed distance function and the immersed boundary method are introduced into the dual grid model. In this technique, two kinds of grids are used to calculate the void fraction and the fluid flow. Thus, this technique makes it possible to simulate a gas-solid flow involving a thin wall. Verification and validation tests are performed to show the adequacy of this technique. Through this study, the proposed technique is illustrated to reproduce the exact solution and experimental results in the gas-solid flow involving the thin wall. Consequently, the proposed technique is shown to yield reasonable results in gas-solid flows involving the thin walls.},

Such simulations are important to analyze mixing efficiency but they have not been conducted previously in a ribbon mixer, owing to complex boundary conditions. The simulations in this study use the discrete element method (DEM) with a wall boundary model based on a signed distance function (SDF). Introduction of the SDF allows for an accurate representation of the boundary, which is important for proper analysis of granular flow in the ribbon mixer. The adequacy of the DEM/SDF approach was validated qualitatively and quantitatively. The degree of mixing in the ribbon mixer was evaluated using a binary mixture mixing index. The effects of the amount of powder, blade speed and initial loading on the degree of mixing were investigated numerically. In the ribbon mixer, the change of mixing state in the axial direction was found to be much smaller than in the perpendicular direction and an increase in the amount of powder and the blade speed generate better mixing. Only the initial loading and amount of powder were found to be critical for good mixing in the ribbon mixer. The mixing mechanism was investigated by DEM/SDF and an optimal initial loading and amount of powder were suggested for better solid mixing.},

  abstract = {The combined computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD–DEM) approach has been proved to be an effective tool to study the fundamentals of different particle–fluid flow systems, but suffers high computational cost problem. Recently, various treatments such as parcel–particle concept, coarse-grained model, similar particle assembly and representative particle model have been developed to reduce the computational cost of CFD–DEM approaches. These treatments are basically empirical and thus their applicability is likely system-dependent. Until now, there are still no general agreements on the formulation of those models and their accuracy and general applicability are largely unknown. In this work, a coarse-grained (CG) (CFD–DEM) model is developed to model the swirling multiphase flow in a dense medium cyclone (DMC) and the error caused by the CG concept is quantified by carrying out controlled numerical calculations to directly compare the simulated results between a standard CFD–DEM model and a CG CFD–DEM model. It demonstrates that when the flow is dilute, the results are independent on the size of the grain (also called as parcel or model particle in this work). Nonetheless, when the flow is dense, small discrepancies are observed between the two models. This work suggests that the CG CFD–DEM model is indeed a useful tool to quickly evaluate the flow and performance of large-scale DMCs and the simulation results should be useful at least qualitatively, if not quantitatively.},

To solve these problems, novel models were developed by our group.

  abstract  = {Dense granular flows are encountered in various engineering fields. The discrete element method (DEM) is used extensively for the numerical simulation of these flow types. Improvements in computer specifications have made it possible to apply the DEM in various systems. Although the DEM is well-established, it has a fatal problem. The problem is that the number of calculated particles is substantially restricted when the simulation needs to be finished within practical time using a single personal computer. On the other hand, many industries require application of the DEM to large scale systems on a single personal computer. We therefore developed the DEM coarse grain model in our previous studies. In the coarse grain model, a group of original particles is simulated using a large-sized particle termed a coarse grain particle, where the total energy is modeled to agree between the coarse grain and original particles. The coarse grain model therefore makes it feasible to perform large scale DEM simulations by using a smaller number of particles than the actual number. The coarse grain model thus far has been verified in two-dimensional fluidized beds. In this study, adequacy of the coarse grain model is verified and validated in a three-dimensional fluidized bed, where scaling ratio is low and high respectively. Consequently, the coarse grain model is shown to simulate the macroscopic behavior of solid particles in three-dimensional dense gas-solid flows. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {Bubbles considerably influence the characteristics of gas-solid fluidized bed, hence play an important role in determining process performance. This paper presents a CFD-DEM study on the effect of particle shape on the bed microstructure and bubble properties in a pseudo-2D bubbling gas-solid fluidized bed, operated with a continuous central jet. The bubble formation process is successfully generated, where bubbles rise through the bed and burst at the top of the bed. The numerical results show that ellipsoids have slightly different flow patterns from those of spheres. However, the mechanisms of bubble splitting and coalescence are found strongly dependent on particle shape. For spheres, the bubble trajectories mainly follow the bed centreline, whereas the bubbles for ellipsoids are widely distributed on both sides of the bed centreline. This result suggests that the lateral drift of bubbles is high for ellipsoids because such particles prefer to orient their longest major axis in the direction of the fluid flow. At the lower part of the bed, both gas and particle velocity profiles are found axially similar to a Gaussian distribution. In contrast, at the upper part of the bed, their peaks become flatter and broader for ellipsoids. Additionally, the bubble equivalent diameters are higher for ellipsoids while bubbles become more circular for spheres. Both bubble frequency and bubble velocity for ellipsoids are lower than spheres. The results obtained from this study can improve the understanding of bubble dynamics in the fluidization of non-spherical particles.},

  abstract  = {The so-called coarse-grained discrete element method (DEM) is used here for efficient simulations of large-scale particle systems as its effectiveness has been successfully verified previously on the processes such as spouted beds, pneumatic conveying systems and bubbling fluidized beds. In this study, the coarse-grained DEM method is used to study the solid-liquid flow in the process of sedimentation of solids in water. Four specific types of particle systems are considered to verify the effectiveness of the coarse-grained model qualitatively and quantitatively, the particle systems considered being: the original-sized particle system; the coarse-grained particle systems in two different coarse graining ratios, and the simple large particle system. For qualitative evaluations of these systems, the evolutions of the sedimentation state, characterized by fluid velocity distributions and contour maps of void fractions, are compared using a range of snapshots at different times. For quantitative comparisons, the physical indexes such as the change of particle volume fraction, the potential energy of particles and liquid pressure changes are evaluated. These systems are also compared using four cases with different variable values for further investigation of the effectiveness of the coarse graining DEM method under different conditions. The four cases consist of one base case and three parametric cases which are different in terms of the particle number and height of the computational domain. These comparisons show that, for all four cases, the coarse-grained system in fact produces results that are in good agreement with those of the original-sized particle system both qualitatively and quantitatively. However, the simple large particle system fails to achieve a reasonable agreement with the original-sized particle system. It can be thus concluded that the coarse-grained model is a cost-effective and reliable tool to simulate the process of large-scale solids sedimentation in water.},

The results show that the fluid velocity and particle diameter have a more remarkable influence on convective heat transfer than conductive heat transfer. Besides, the particle-fluid convection dominates the heat transfer while the particle-particle conduction is almost negligible. The particle-fluid-particle conduction occupies about 10{\%} of the total heat transfer. Finally, the model is successfully applied in a circulating fluidized bed. The average mass fractions of solid materials in the riser, cyclone, and dipleg are 0.737, 0.023, and 0.240, respectively. Solid internal circulations and lower solid velocities in the horizontal part of dipleg lead to a two-peak histogram distribution of particles temperature in the riser and the system.},

To study these systems, simulations of wet particles with small amounts of liquid are often performed by incorporating liquid bridge forces consisting of capillary and viscous forces into Discrete Element Method (DEM) (Sakai and Koshizuka, 2009). One of the existing challenges in DEM is the high computational cost to perform industrial scale simulations with large number of particles. One of the strategies often employed to reduce computational cost is by scaling up particle size, also known as the coarse grain method, which have been applied in several studies for dry cohesionless or dry cohesive particles. In the present work, the “direct force scaling” coarse grain model (Sakai and Koshizuka, 2009; Sakai et al., 2012) is applied for a dense and dynamic system of wet particles with liquid bridge forces. A general scaling criteria is proposed for different types of DEM related forces based on force balances on a control volume: l3 scaling for body forces and l2 scaling for interaction forces, where l is the scaling factor of the coarse grain particle. The coarse grain model is validated for wet particles in a vertical mixer in terms of the bulk flow and mixing behaviour. It is shown that the coarse grain model with l2 scaling of the liquid bridge forces can accurately predict the flow and mixing behaviour of the original wet particles.},

Practically, this model uses a simple operation to create the wall boundary. Although the SDF is a scalar field for the wall boundary of the DEM, it is useful for the wall boundary of the CFD through combination with the IBM. Validation tests are carried out to demonstrate the adequacy of the SDF/IBM wall boundary model. Regarding the mesh-free particle method for continuum, the phase change problem is one of the challenging topics, as the solid state is usually modeled by extremely high viscous fluid in the phase change simulation. The phase change simulation is shown to be efficiently performed through an implicit algorithm and a heat flux model in the MPS method. The adequacy of these models is verified by the numerical examples.},

  abstract  = {A theoretical study of the interaction term in the two-fluid model equations is presented. The relevant NavierStokes equation is volume-integrated in a control volume fixed in a field of dispersed two-phase flow; then it is time-integrated. An expression for the interaction term is obtained in the limit of infinitesimal control volume, which rigorously fits to the two-fluid model equation based on time averaging. The interaction term is then analysed for dispersed two-phase flow with homogeneous particle size. The mathematical expression of the resulting interaction term clearly shows its property, which has been overlooked for more than 40 years. It can be decomposed into the conventional interaction term and an additional virtual force term. The virtual force term is evaluated approximately for two types of dispersed multiphase flow in order to demonstrate its effectiveness. The first is solidliquid dispersed two-phase flow with spherical solid particles undergoing creeping flow, and the second is gasliquid dispersed two-phase flow with large bubbles in a highly turbulent flow field. For solid spherical particles in a homogeneous creeping flow, the term vanishes, as was found numerically by Ten Cate and Sundaresan (Intl J. Multiphase Flow, vol. 32, 2006, pp. 106131), although the term could be significant for a flow field with velocity gradient. For large bubbles in bubble columns in a recirculating turbulent flow regime, the term is significant. The two-fluid model equations are corrected by the introduction of these virtual force terms, which in some circumstances are important in simulating the macroscopic properties of dispersed two-phase flow with spatial variations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Cambridge University Press.},

  abstract = {Based on the Eulerian spatial averaging theory and the M{\"{u}}ller–Liu entropy principle, a two-fluid model for reactive dilute solid–liquid mixtures is presented. Initially, some averaging theorems and properties of average quantities are discussed and, then, averaged balance equations including interfacial source terms are postulated. Moreover, constitutive equations are proposed for a reactive dilute solid–liquid mixture, where the formation of the solid phase is due to a precipitation chemical reaction that involves ions dissolved in the liquid phase. To this end, principles of constitutive theory are used to propose linearized constitutive equations that account for diffusion, heat conduction, viscous and drag effects, and interfacial deformations. A particularity of the model is that the mass interfacial source term is regarded as an independent constitutive variable. The obtained results show that the inclusion of the mass interfacial source term into the set of independent constitutive variables permits to easily describe the phase changes associated with precipitation chemical reactions.},

Comparisons are made against the more common algorithm in which the solid fraction is determined by assigning the sphere's total volume to the bin in which the sphere's center of volume (COV) is located. Bin size-to-sphere diameter ratios {\textgreater}30 must be used to give errors {\textless}5{\%} when using the traditional method when applied to simple cubic (SC) and hexagonal packing assemblies.

  abstract = {Euler-Lagrange simulations of gas-solid flows in unbounded domains have been performed to study sub-grid modeling of the filtered drag force for non-cohesive and cohesive particles. The filtered drag forces under various microstructures and flow conditions were analyzed in terms of various sub-grid quantities: the sub-grid drift velocity, which stems from the sub-grid correlation between the local fluid velocity and the local particle volume fraction, and the scalar variance of solid volume fraction, which is a measure to identify the degree of local inhomogeneity of volume fraction within a filter volume. The results show that the drift velocity and the scalar variance exert systematic effects on the filtered drag force. Effects of particle and domain sizes, gravitational accelerations, and mass loadings on the filtered drag are also studied, and it is shown that these effects can be captured by both sub-grid quantities. Additionally, the effect of cohesion force through the van der Waals interaction on the filtered drag force is investigated, and it is found that there is no significant difference on the dependence of the filtered drag coefficient of cohesive and non-cohesive particles on the sub-grid drift velocity or the scalar variance of solid volume fraction. The assessment of predictabilities of sub-grid quantities was performed by correlation coefficient analyses in a priori manner, and it is found that the drift velocity is superior. However, the drift velocity is not available in "coarse-grid" simulations and a specific closure is needed. A dynamic scale-similarity approach was used to model drift velocity but the predictability of that model is not entirely satisfactory. It is concluded that one must develop a more elaborate model for estimating the drift velocity in "coarse-grid" simulations.},

  abstract  = {In this study the simulations of granular flow in a batch mixer with independent double axial mixing are presented. The simulated granular flows were used to analyze the mixing efficiency. Such analysis has not been conducted previously for such a batch mixer, because of the complex mixing conditions. The simulations performed in this study use the discrete element method (DEM) with a wall boundary model based on a signed distance function (SDF). Introduction of the SDF allows for an accurate representation of the boundary, which is important for proper analysis of granular flow in the batch mixer. The adequacy of the DEM/SDF approach was validated quantitatively in experiments. The degree of mixing in the batch mixer was evaluated using a mixing index of a binary mixture. The effects of the powder amount, blade speed, initial loading patterns and secondary mixing on the degree of mixing were investigated numerically. In the batch mixer considered in this work, the change in mixing state in the axial direction was found to be much smaller than that in the perpendicular direction. The increase in the mixing speed not only reduces mixing time but also substantially increases the mixing performance if measured per number of rotations. However, the increase in the powder amount reduces the mixing performance. The additional secondary mixing affects the axial-mixing performance. However, the overall mixing performance does not change. In addition, neither the mixing axis position nor the mixing speed appreciably affects the mixing performance. All the mixing differences can be associated with the differences in the granular behavior, irrespective of different speeds, powder amounts or mixing setups.},

  abstract  = {An accurate numerical model is proposed to simulate flow through cylindrical fixed-bed reactors with randomly packed porous non-spherical particles. The length scale for flow outside the porous particles (made of open-cell foam) is O(102) higher than the size of the internal micro-pores of the particles. To capture the flow at these two different length scales, a multiscale modeling approach, derived using volume averaging theory (VAT), is developed. The flow through and around the porous particles is computed as a single hydrodynamic field in a Cartesian computational domain. The flow within the inter-particle space is fully resolved, whereas, flow at the scale of the intra-particle micro-pores is not resolved and instead represented by closure terms. Random packings of cubic and cuboid particles in cylindrical columns of different diameter are generated using a glued-sphere Discrete Element Method (DEM) approach. The packing structures for different particle-column combinations are analysed. The effects of particle size/shape, column diameter and internal porosity of the particles on the overall pressure drop and flow distribution are investigated. The macroscopic Reynolds number (based on the particle equivalent diameter and the superficial velocity of the bed) is varied from 0.1 to 400. The effect of Reynolds number on pressure drop is analyzed, as well as the reduction in pressure drop due to the presence of the intra-particle pores. In addition, our numerical simulations have helped to elucidate the detailed fluid-solid interaction in complex bi-disperse, dual porosity porous media.},

Particle velocities and particle concentration were measured by capacitance probe for the validation of the numerical model. The simulations were carried out using a homogenous drag model and a structure dependent drag model using the theory of energy minimization multiscale method (EMMS). Numerical parameters like grid resolution and computational time were investigated for the coarse grain CFD-DEM model, suggesting a cell uniformity criteria that might lead to more mesh independent results. The simulated macroscopic quantities such as pressure profile are generally in good agreement for all simulated cases using the EMMS model. Microscopic quantities such as particles velocities and solids concentration are partially matched well with the experimental data. The qualitative profiles of particle velocity and particle concentration are in better agreement for the EMMS model than for the homogenous drag model. The simulated reactor outflux using glass beads is well matched with experiment. The simulated reactor outflux with sand material is overestimated with EMMS model, although not that strong as for the Gidaspow model, in comparison to experimental measurements. One reason for the discrepancy is due to the cluster diameter correlation that require further development to be applicable in turbulent fluidization flow regime. Further model improvements are discussed and solutions are provided.},

The discharge of hoppers is one of the most important issues in the industry, and our main focus in this project is the discharge behavior in the hoppers. Many factors affect the flow rate and discharge time in the hoppers including particle shape, material properties and hopper type. In this study, discharge of non-spherical particles from the flat bottom hoppers has been simulated using a discrete element method (DEM), which is a technique for granular systems. In order to model the elliptical particles in the experiment, multi-sphere method was used, which is a suitable method for approximation of curved and smooth surface particles. Model was validated using experimental results in the literature and good agreement between them in particle static packing, the flow behavior and hopper discharging rates was found. An important factor that influences the accuracy of the simulation of non-spherical granular systems is the accuracy in modeling of the particles. For this purpose, non-spherical granular particles were modeled with several arrangements of spheres, and the effect of three parameters including the number of spheres forming particles, shape factor, and angularity factor (which indicates the accuracy of the particle shape approximation), on the simulation accuracy was studied. The results briefly showed that the angularity factor, which is a factor affecting the particle surface properties, is an effective parameter controlling the simulation accuracy, such that the linear relationship (R2 of 0.96 and 0.91) exists between the angularity factor and simulation accuracy.},

In this paper, the discrete element method (DEM) is applied to simulate the behavior of spherical particles and non-spherical particles motion on an inclined vibrating plate (IVP), and the influence of different operating parameters on the separation performance of the mixed particles is investigated. In the DEM simulations, both the spherical and non-spherical particles are modeled by super-ellipsoids. The simulation results show that the optimal vibration amplitude and frequency exist for the high separation efficiency of the mixed particles. The separation efficiency can also be enhanced by properly increasing the friction coefficient or decreasing the restitution coefficient between particles and plate. It is easier to separate the non-spherical particles from the spherical particles by diminishing the sphericity of particles. Besides, as long as the inclination angle of the plate is set at appropriate range and the feed rate of the mixed particles is moderate, the non-spherical particles can be separated effectively from the spherical particles. This research could be helpful for the understanding and optimal design of vibration sorting device.},

  abstract  = {It is the basic objective of a solid mixing process to avoid any segregation effects. Especially free-flowing bulk solids with weak interparticle adhesive forces tend to percolating segregation. Liquid addition, which is common in mixing granulation processes, will usually reduce the particle segregation due to pendular liquid bridge networks. However, liquid addition can result in a change of the segregation mechanism. For example: water may accumulate selectively in one component when hydrophilic and hydrophobic solids need to be mixed. Heteroagglomerates that consist mainly of one solid component may arise and degrade the final product quality. In this work the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is applied to investigate mixing and segregation of moist particulate solids in more detail. During particle collision liquid is transferred from one to the other contact partner until the liquid is uniformly distributed in the bulk. The available liquid bridge models assume complete particle wetting or neglect that the mixing components may differ in their contact angle. We developed the liquid contact dispersion model further in order to realize partial particle wetting that includes drop formation on the particle surface. A comparison between the common film model and the proposed model shows an improvement in experimental validation when the partial particle wetting model is included in the DEM simulation. The assessment of these models is carried out by evaluating mixing efficiency and liquid distribution.},

  abstract  = {Granular solids mixing is a pivotal unit operation in manufacturing processes for numerous industries such as pharmaceuticals, food, and petroleum refining, wherein mixture homogeneity is critical to ensure for product quality and control. In this work, Discrete Element Modeling (DEM) was used to study mixing of cohesive granular solids using a rotary kiln. This work's goal was to develop a quantitative relationship between particle properties and their simulated mixing behavior. Particle properties evaluated in this work were surface energy, particle density, and particle diameter given their relationship to particle cohesion, often quantitatively measured using the granular Bond number. For the simulations, the rotary kiln's fill level, cylinder dimensions, and angular velocity remained constant while the particle properties changed. The DEM simulated mixing results were used to regress the dispersion coefficient for the closed-closed boundary axial dispersion to quantify mixing rates. The results indicated that both surface energy and true density were negatively correlated with axial dispersion, while particle size was positively correlated. From these results and analysis, an empirical correlation was developed between the evaluated particle properties and the regressed axial dispersion constant. The empirical correlation was employed to evaluate the rates of mixing inside the rotary kiln using relative standard deviation as a mixing metric.},

Two impeller designs having different arm length were investigated as function of low and high rotational speeds (50 rpm and 250 rpm). A coarse graining (CG) tool was applied for the first time to time average the DEM data of a vertical stirred mill for the generation of continuous fields of grinding media flow properties such as: solid fraction, kinetics and hydrostatic pressure. This allowed the extraction of meaningful information to generate insights on the grinding process as well as the detailed analysis of the grinding media dynamics at different vessel locations.},

  abstract  = {Ball mills have a low efficiency rate partially due to the lack of a proper method to monitor the mill filling level, which makes it difficult to control the grinding process. The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibilities that DEM offers to characterize the load torque of tumbling ball mills in the frequency domain and, from this characterization, to establish the basis of a methodology capable of estimating the mill filling level. To achieve this, a pilot scale ball mill was considered and a campaign of simulations and experimental tests was carried out in dry grinding conditions, considering variables such as the rotation speed of the mill, the type of particle to be grinded, and the mill filling level. For each simulation, spectral analysis of torque data generated by DEM software was performed. The results obtained from simulations and subsequent torque data processing show the possibility of characterizing the load torque of ball mills in the frequency domain without the influence of components alien to the grinding process. In this paper, it is shown that load torque signal in ball mills contains enough information to characterize, unambiguously, the load level of the mill. Thus, a methodology to evaluate the mill filling level based on torque spectral analysis is proposed.},

Numerical simulations appear to be a promising means to fill this gap. The vertical loads on inserts immersed in wheat contained in a model silo were measured in static and discharge conditions. A flat floor, smooth wall test silo, 1.5 m in height and 0.4 m in diameter, was used. Inserts in the shape of cones, discs, and cylinders were axially suspended on three cords at three heights. A series of discrete element method (DEM) simulations were performed with an assembly of 75,000 spherical particles with a random uniform distribution of diameters with an average of 3.79 ± 0.04 mm placed in the cylindrical container with a diameter of 0.12 m. The set-up of the DEM simulations reproduced the results of the laboratory tests. Despite the very large differences in the number of particles in the real and simulated deposits, the results of simulations and laboratory testing were in good agreement. Thus, DEM was found to be a promising method for the estimation of loads exerted by stagnant or flowing granular material on inserts, as well as for the determination of dead zones and the geometry of the flow channel.},

  abstract  = {Ignoring the effect of cohesion between particles in Discrete Element Method (DEM) may incur in errors in the predictions of bulk properties. In this research work, we investigated the role of the cohesion force on macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of monodisperse and bidisperse iron ore granule systems, specifically on the angle of repose and coordination number of the assemblies. In order to simulate the cohesion between particles, a combination of the Hertz contact force and the pull-off force as predicted by the JKR model was employed. The monodisperse systems were made of particles whose sizes ranged between 3 and 10 mm. In order to analyse the effect of bidispersity on the characteristics of the particle assemblies, combinations of 10 mm particles with smaller particles (from 3 to 7 mm) were considered. The results showed that similarly to the rolling friction force, the cohesion force caused a considerable increase in the angle of repose, for the whole particle size range here studied. More importantly by increasing particle size, the rate at which the angle of repose increased as a result of the cohesion force, decreased significantly. This influence became more outstanding by increasing the value of the rolling friction coefficient, signifying the interplay between rolling friction force and cohesion force. In contrast to the case of non-cohesive particles, the effect of particle size on the angle of repose was independent of the rolling friction force in the presence of cohesion force and led to a decrease in the angle of repose for the entire range of rolling friction coefficient values. An empirical analysis of the obtained angles of repose confirmed the strong dependency of the angles on the Bond number and the rolling friction coefficient for cohesive particles. In addition, the coordination number of all studied systems was influenced by both parameters, as the value of coordination number increased by increasing cohesion force but decreased by increasing rolling friction force.},

The simulated and experimental results showed that an increase in feed rate (from 6 kg/s/m to 18 kg/s/m) significantly decreased the level of vertical size segregation and the granule packing voidage of each bed sub-layer. With the increase in rill plate angle (from 45° to 65°), the level of vertical size segregation first decreased and, then, remained relatively constant. Furthermore, the results indicated that the voidage of each bed sub-layer generally increased with the increase in $\lambda$. In conclusion, enhancing the vertical size segregation down the green bed can generally improve the voidage of the green bed and thus increase the bed permeability.},

  abstract  = {Graphics processing unit (GPU)-based DEM combined with message passing interface (MPI) has been applied to large-scale handling and processing systems, including granular conveying, reclaiming, screening, ship loading, grab and screw unloading, and blast furnace top charging systems. The issues in terms of particle flow behaviour, particle-wall interaction/wall stress, particle energy dissipation, size segregation, and process efficiency, etc., are discussed. The results showed that for a belt conveying chute, wear became more severe at higher flow rates. In the reclaiming process, there was an increase in the digging resistance on the buckets with increasing bucket rotation speed. For the screening process, lower vibrating frequency lead to a higher screening efficiency, but also higher wall stresses. In a ship loading process, particle streams with a wide size distribution provided a significant cushioning effect on particle degradation, and when the dropping height reduces, the dissipated energy by particle-particle impacts greatly reduced. For a grab unloader, particle velocities became smaller with an increase in grab close time with tangential stresses only slightly reduced within the close time range considered. An increase of rotational speed of the bottom blades of a screw unloader indicated a higher unloading efficiency. A full blast furnace top charging process model was also developed. Size segregation was observed at different stages of the charging process. This paper demonstrated that GPU-based DEM can be successfully applied to the whole granular process chain of ironmaking related industries at different scales and provide guidelines for the key issues in different processes.},

Silo design codes propose a method to estimate the friction on corrugated walls, but important aspects of the problem are not considered. This paper presents DEM simulations for a flat-bottom silo with different corrugation depths. Results show the differences in the friction of particles stored in a silo against a corrugated wall from a smooth wall, thus producing changes in many aspects such as flow, velocity of particles or friction coefficient. Flow rates and velocity of particles were higher for models with larger corrugation depths, especially for the initial period of discharge. Greater mobilization of particle-to-particle friction coefficient and higher values for contact normal forces were also detected as the value of the depth of the corrugation increased.},

  abstract = {Considering being applied to industrial applications with billions of particles, the discrete element method (DEM) is still limited by the computational competence of computers, regardless of the advances in computer hardware or parallel programming techniques. In this paper, therefore, a coarse-grain (CG) discrete element method is adopted to deal with the immense number of particles in granular mixing, which has the potential to gain considerable computational advantage for industry scale DEM simulations. The experiment results as well as the simulation results prove the validity of taking place of smaller particles by larger particles with sacrificing a little detail in a drum flow. The simulation results also indicate that the rotation speed of the drum nearly has no effect on the application of the CG-DEM. The mixing tendency as well as the flow pattern of particles in the CG system is quite similar to the original system. In addition, the simulation results of an industrial application show that the CG-DEM is applicable to the double-screw conical mixer. The granular mixing in the double-screw conical mixer can be predicted by the CG-DEM, and the prediction of device power consumption is accurate by correcting the friction coefficient based on the theory of the CG-DEM, and the prediction of the wear rate of the device is broadly accurate after being corrected by a correction factor. Using CG-DEM can efficiently save computational cost with cutting back on the level of detail and accuracy.},

  abstract = {The mixing of a cohesive drug with a cohesive, non-cohesive and free-flowing excipient was studied using two types of mixers, cylindrical shear and V-shaped tumbling. Two mixing indices, one based on complete random mixing, s/$\sigma$R, and the other based on standard specifications, s/$\sigma$A, were used to evaluate the data. Both indices gave similar results for mixing cohesive drug with a free-flowing or non-cohesive excipient and were suitable for evaluating homogeneity. However, for mixing a cohesive drug with a cohesive excipient, s/$\sigma$R was not a suitable index, while s/$\sigma$A could be used. The 'mixing margin', a concept proposed by Hersey [3], is not a very useful tool in assessing mix-ability of powders having too large or too small particle size distributions. Because of electrostatic charging, preferential sticking of the drug to the walls of the mixer resulted in a lower mean value of the drug in the mixture. Although the mixing indices suggested that the desired mixedness was reached, it is proposed that the mean percent of the active ingredient should be checked in addition to the mixing indices for ensuring the uniformity and potency of the drug content in solid state mixtures. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

  abstract  = {Palladium-based membrane-assisted fluidized bed reactors have been proposed for the production of ultra-pure hydrogen at small scales. Due to the improved heat and mass transfer characteristics inside such reactors, it is commonly believed that they can outperform packed bed membrane reactor configurations. It has been widely shown that the performance of packed bed membrane reactors can suffer from serious mass transfer limitations from the bulk of the catalyst bed to the surface of the membranes (concentration polarization) when using modern highly permeable membranes. The extent of concentration polarization in fluidized bed membrane reactors has not yet been researched in detail. In this work, we have quantified the concentration polarization effect inside fluidized bed membrane reactors with immersed vertical membranes with high hydrogen fluxes. A Two-Fluid Model (TFM) was used to quantify the extent of concentration polarization and to visualize the concentration profiles near the membrane. The concentration profiles were simplified to a mass transfer boundary layer (typically 1 cm in thickness), which was implemented in a 1D fluidized bed membrane reactor model to account for the concentration polarization effects. Predictions by the TFM and the extended 1D model showed very good agreement with experimental hydrogen flux data. The experiments and models show that concentration polarization can reduce the hydrogen flux by a factor of 3 even at low H2 concentrations in the feed (10{\%}), which confirms that concentration polarization can also significantly affect the performance of fluidized bed membrane reactors when integrating highly permeable membranes, but to a somewhat lesser extent than packed bed membrane reactors. The extraction of hydrogen also affects the gas velocity and solids hold-up profiles in the fluidized bed.},

A detailed investigation is carried out on porosity distribution, bed expansion, bypass ratio, and bubble characteristics. At low pressure, the porosity distribution is non-homogeneous with increased bubble activity near walls. A decrease in bed porosity and bubble splitting is observed as the operating pressure is reduced.

To this end, we have developed a model in which the behavior of a population of particles is obtained from an ensemble of individual particle dissolution models. The dissolution of an individual semicrystalline polymer particle involves decrystallization and disentanglement as two important and potentially rate-determining steps in the process. Using this population ensemble model, novel results on the evolution of cellulose particle size distribution and polydispersity over the dissolution time have been obtained, and the impact on dissolution of the particle size distribution width and mean particle size has been examined at different conditions. The high number of smaller particles determines initially the dissolution behavior of a polydisperse system, however, at long dissolution times, relatively small numbers of larger particles dictate the overall dissolution behavior. Reducing the mean particle size increases the dissolved fraction more at disentanglement control conditions than at decrystallization control conditions. Having a wider particle size distribution would always increase the cellulosic biomass solubility at disentanglement control conditions. At decrystallization control conditions, a wider size distribution is beneficial initially, however, at long times a system with narrower particle distribution dissolves more. Findings from this study would benefit the rational design and optimization of pretreatment processes to reduce the particle size for enhanced biomass utilization. The developed model can be applied to the dissolution of polydisperse particles for various polymers of interest to drug delivery and plastics recycling.},

  abstract  = {The formation of gas bubbles by submerged orifices in a cross-flowing liquid is encountered in many industrial applications. It is therefore important to understand the dynamics of bubble formation and to accurately predict the bubble detachment characteristics under such situations. In the present work, the process is numerically studied using the Local Front Reconstruction Method (LFRM), a Front Tracking Direct Numerical Simulation method that enables the simulation of interface merging and breakup. Experiments of bubble formation subjected to cross-flow induced shear are also performed to provide data for the validation of the numerical simulations. The predictions of the bubble shape and the detached bubble volume obtained by the numerical model show good agreement with the experimental results. The validated numerical model is then used to study the effects of volumetric gas flow rate and fluid physical properties on the bubble detachment characteristics under various shear rates in the quasi-static bubble growth regime. The simulation results show that the shear flow advances the bubble detachment and decreases the bubble size. Consequently, the bubble formation frequency and the detached bubble size can be controlled by exerting different shear rates. At higher shear rates, the simulated bubbles are highly deformed due to the drag force created by the tangential liquid flow and the influence of liquid properties on the bubble detachment characteristics becomes less significant.},

The geometry of the random packed bed has been obtained in a separate simulation based on a sequential deposition of particles in a cylindrical column and a simplified mechanics with additional radial force allowing for higher packing densities. The first part of the work focuses on comparison of the packings of cylinders and rings with respect to their ability to distribute the flow uniformly over the cross-section of the column when the gas in the form of a narrow jet enters along the column axis and impinges on the bed directly. The second part is devoted to analysis of three different inlet configurations and their influence on gas maldistribution in the packing of Raschig rings. It has been found that the random packing of rings has comparable properties of flow uniformisation to the same arrangement of full cylinders with significantly lower pressure drop and much less pronounced effect of formation of localised jets at the bed outlet. Among the considered inlet configurations the most beneficial is the one in which the gas duct is tangential to the walls of the distribution chamber.},

At the solid fluid interface, an effective conductivity is introduced to satisfy the heat flux continuity. The effective thermal conductivity is obtained by considering the heat balance at the interface or by using a harmonic mean formulation. The method is first validated against the analytic solution to the heat transfer problem in a fully developed laminar channel flow with conducting solid walls.

  abstract = {Fluidised beds play an important role in physical and chemical engineering processing. Understanding the granular motion within these beds is essential for design, optimisation and control of such processes. Motion on the particle scale is difficult to measure experimentally, making computational simulations invaluable for determining the dynamics within such systems. Computational models which have had the greatest success at capturing the full range of dynamics are coupled discrete element model and Navier-Stokes solvers, based on a pressure-gradient-force formulation. However, most discrete element models assume spherical geometry for the particles. Particle shape in many important industrial processes, such as catalysis and pyrolysis, is often non-spherical. We present a re-formulation of the pressure-gradient force model, based on a modified pressure correction method, coupled to a discrete element model with non-spherical grains. The drag relations for the coupling are modified to take into account the grain shape and cross-sectional area relative to the local gas flow. We show that grain shape has a significant effect on the dynamics of the fluidised bed, including increased pressure gradients within the bed and lower fluidisation velocities when compared to beds of spherical particles. A model is presented to explain these effects, showing that they are due to both decreased porosity within the bed as well as the relative particle cross-sectional area creating a greater net drag over the bed. Our findings will be of interest from an applied standpoint as well as showing fundamental effects of particle shape on coupled fluid and granular flow. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009.},

This paper presents a review of the recent efforts in developing DEM approaches to model non-spherical particulate systems (NSPS) and strategies of coupling such a non-spherical DEM model with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for particle-fluid flows. It mainly covers four important aspects: the techniques for representation of non-spherical particles and their contact detection, the models describing inter-particle collision dynamics and fluid-particle forces, CFD-DEM coupling methodologies including averaged volume method and immersed family methods and the applications of the developed theories to the modelling of different NSPS.

Two types of spout deflections – alternating and non-alternating spout deflections are captured by the CFD-DEM simulations and qualitatively analyzed in terms of voidage distributions and particle momentum profiles. The spout deflection angle is defined and used to characterize the intensity of spout deflection quantitatively. Then, the effects of spouting velocity on alternating spout deflection are investigated quantitatively using the spout deflection angle. The simulation results indicate that spouting velocity has a limited effect on the amplitude and frequency of alternating spout deflection. The relation between solid flow pattern and spout behaviour are also investigated with the help of spout deflection angle. The results indicate that spout deflection angle is highly relevant to particle distribution non-uniformity at the upper region of the bed.

Several hydrodynamic parameters, including the void and solid fraction, the average particle speed, the granular temperature and the fluctuation energy (defined as the sum of the granular temperature) have been obtained and analyzed. Since the hydrodynamic properties have great effect on erosion of the immersed tube, a quantitative analysis was carried out based on the hydrodynamic parameters around the tubes. An intrinsic relation between erosion on the immersed tube and the fluctuation energy has been revealed based on the analysis, which indicates that the fluctuation energy of the particles near the tube probably is the main reason for the erosion.

The methodology is applied to a fluidized bed of approximately 80 000 solid particles subject to internal heat production and fluidization with cool gas for a duration of 800 s. The fluid's thermal expansion due to heat transfer ([290 K; 430 K]) and the varying inlet velocities ([0.4 m/s; 0.9 m/s]) cause the desired transiency. We find excellent agreement for particle mean temperatures over time and qualitative similarity for their standard deviation between detailed, established simulation techniques and rCFD with speed-ups of more than two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we present implementation advancements concerning parallel data exchange and compare all-to-all with one-to-one communication schemes.

Three dimensional gas-solid two phase flow characteristics in a novel spouted bed structure under the longitudinal vortex effects was numerically investigated by two-fluid model (TFM) with kinetic theory for granular flow. Simulations and analyses have been conducted on three types of spouted beds: without disturbance units, with a pair of balls and with a pair of longitudinal vortex generators (LVGs). The simulation results show that: the fountain height decreases significantly when LVGs are installed in spouted bed, causing the secondary vortex flow. A pair of symmetrical distribution longitudinal vortex appear in the cross section of spouted bed under the action of LVGs, both for the gas phase and particle phase. The particle volume fraction near the central spout region, the radial velocity and granular temperature of particle phase in spouted bed can be promoted significantly by longitudinal vortex. Also, the value of turbulent kinetic energy of gas phase can be obviously enhanced by longitudinal vortex along the axial direction in spouted bed. As a result, the radial mixing of particles and gas phase between central spout and annulus in spouted bed can be significantly enhanced by the longitudinal vortex.},

In the vitrification process, the HLLW will be mixed with molten glass in a joule-heated glass melter. The molten glass is then poured into a canister through a nozzle at the bottom of the melter. When some abnormalities occurred, feature of the discharged flow become different from that in normal conditions. We cannot observe the state of the molten glass inside the melter directly because of the severe environment. Accordingly, we cannot investigate the cause when the abnormalities occurred. Hence, numerical simulation of the discharged flow becomes important to understand and recover from operational problems or abnormalities with the glass melter. However, existing numerical models of the glass melter do not really simulate the discharged glass flow. In the present study, we introduce a new algorithm into an existing Lagrangian approach to efficiently simulate the discharged glass flow. To verify the model, 3D simulations were performed on a real scale system and got compared with the results of experimental validation tests. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental results. Consequently, the new Lagrangian approach accurately simulates the molten glass flow. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract  = {Rotating drums are widely used in industry for mixing, milling, coating and drying processes. In the past decades, mixing of granular materials in rotating drums has been extensively investigated, but most of the studies are based on spherical particles. Particle shape has an influence on the flow behaviour and thus mixing behaviour, though the shape effect has as-yet received limited study. In this work, discrete element method (DEM) is employed to study the transverse mixing of ellipsoidal particles in a rotating drum. The effects of aspect ratio and rotating speed on mixing quality and mixing rate are investigated. The results show that mixing index increases exponentially with time for both spheres and ellipsoids. Particles with various aspect ratios are able to reach well-mixed states after sufficient revolutions in the rolling or cascading regime. Ellipsoids show higher mixing rate when rotational speed is set between 25 and 40 rpm. The relationship between mixing rate and aspect ratio of ellipsoids is established, demonstrating that, particles with aspect ratios of 0.5 and 2.0 achieve the highest mixing rates. Increasing rotating speed from 15 rpm to 40 rpm does not necessarily increase the mixing speed of spheres, while monotonous increase is observed for ellipsoids.},

However, in contrast to other mill types, no applicable mechanistic model exists to describe the stressing conditions and their effect on particle breakage, so that processes are empirically evaluated so far. Within this study, the stressing conditions are determined by simulations based on the discrete element method including the contact model of Hertz and Mindlin. The contact model parameters are carefully calibrated by a series of experiments, so that it is finally possible to validate the simulation results by comparison of measured and calculated power values. The correlation of stressing conditions and breakage rates of alumina powder demonstrates the effect of stressing on breakage kinetics and breakage mechanism. It allows calculating the active mass in dependence on process parameters by an extension of Sch{\"{o}}nert's active mass model. Altogether, the presented stressing model features analytical functions for the mill-related stressing conditions and highlights the importance of stressing intensity as process determining parameter, which defines the required number of material-related stressing events and the specific energy.},

  abstract  = {The Euler-Lagrange approach combined with a deterministic collision model, so-called discrete element method, is investigated. In this work, the physical values of fluid and particle phases are determined in separated grids. The proposed procedure allows the variation of the fluid grid resolution independent of the particle size and consequently improves the calculation accuracy. A validation study has been performed to assess the results obtained from an in-house CFD/DEM code and a quasi-2D spouted-fluidized bed of Plexiglas{\textregistered}. The results suggest that the extended CFD/DEM model can predict accurately the particles motion and the pressure gradients in the bed. In view of the high computing cost, special emphasis is put on an effective program design such as the application of the multi-grid method and the parallel calculation. Hence, the influence of increasing the processor numbers (up to 36) on the calculation efficiency of the extended CFD/DEM model will be analysed. Finally, the improved CFD/DEM model is applied to simulate relevant engineering equipments but in small scale with relative large particles and thus less number of particles. In this context, the hydrodynamic behaviour of gas-solid flow in a 3D circulating fluidized bed with a particle separator (cyclone) will be estimated. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

The relatively comprehensive investigations are performed in order to understand the fluidization behaviors of disk-like particles and to evaluate how the aspect ratio influences the fluidization. The results obtained demonstrate that disk-like particles with a larger aspect ratio possess stronger particle movement and more apparent fluidization. Comparisons between spherical particles and disk-like particles elucidate their differences in the fluidization behavior. Particle orientation is also investigated in this paper due to its important influence on the fluidization. Particles possess different preferred orientations in the static bed and in the fluidization state, and a reduced aspect ratio can drive particles to be in the preferred orientation. The existence of the walls will prompt particles to align their cross sections to be parallel to the plane of the walls.},

The effects of inlet angle and particle size on separation efficiency are quantified. The separation efficiency is increased with an increase of particle size, while the separation efficiency firstly increases and then declined as inlet angle changes from negative to positive.

The simulations are carried out using a coupled CFD-DEM approach (CFD: Computational Fluid Dynamics; DEM: Discrete Element Method). After validating an open-source CFD-DEM software tool for this purpose, regions within the crystallizer with unfavorable hydrodynamic features and thus a negatively impacted process outcome have been identified. This was first accomplished by single-phase CFD simulations. Then, the validated CFD-DEM model delivers valuable information that is difficult or even impossible to measure experimentally with sufficient accuracy, such as the velocity and position of fluidized crystals within the crystallizer. Since the simulations are computationally challenging, a compromise between simulated process time and number of simulated particles must be found. Hence, the CFD-DEM simulations are not utilized to simulate the whole crystallization process, but to examine a short time-window in detail. Corresponding findings confirm proper fluidization of the crystals support the model reduction carried out in a parallel project.},

Criticality evaluations considering the nuclear particle movement in a rotating cylindrical tank are performed by applying this tool. Effects of the powder-filling ratio and the rotating speed on nuclear criticality are investigated in the present study. The nuclear powder free surface is fluctuated more remarkably as the filling ratio and the rotating speed are higher. The fluctuation makes the effective multiplication factor lower because of neutron leakage from the system by the increase of the superficial area and reduction of the atomic number densities due to the flowability. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, Ltd.},

We propose a new algorithm for multi-thread parallel computation of DEM, which makes effective use of the available memory and accelerates the computation. This study shows that memory usage is drastically reduced by using this algorithm. To show the practical use of DEM in industry, a large-scale powder system is simulated with a complicated drive unit. We compared the performance of the simulation between the latest GPU and CPU processors with optimized programs for each processor.

  abstract  = {This article presents a two-dimensional study of the gas-solid flow in a vertical pneumatic conveying pipe by means of a hard-sphere model where the motion of individual particles can be traced. Simulations were performed for a pipe of height 0.9 m and width 0.06 m, with air as gas phase and particles of density 900 kg/m3 and diameter 0.003 m as solid phase. Periodic boundary conditions were applied to the solid phase in the axial direction. Different cases were simulated to examine the effects of the number of particles used, superficial gas velocity, and restitution coefficient. The results show that the main features of plug flow can be reasonably captured by the proposed simulation technique. That is, increasing the number of particles in a simulation will increase the length of plugs but does not change the velocity of plugs: the solid fraction of a plug is relatively low if the number of particles is small. In particular, it is shown that increasing superficial gas velocity will increase the velocity of plugs and the frequency of plugs, and the pressure drop through a rising plug increases linearly with the plug length, suggesting that the total pressure of a conveying system with a given length can be quantified from the information of plug length and plug frequency. Increasing the restitution coefficient can promote the momentum transfer between particles and hence the raining down of particles from the back of a plug in vertical pneumatic conveying. The simulation offers a useful technique to understand the fundamentals governing the gas-solid flow under pneumatic conveying conditions. Copyright {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Inc.},

Few of these applications will be examined in more detail to show how insights into the fundamentals of these processes can be gained through DEM modelling. Some examples of our collaborative validation efforts will also be described.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a numerical study of particle-fluid flow in complex three-dimensional (3D) systems by means of Combined Continuum and Discrete Method (CCDM). In the CCDM, the motion of discrete particles phase is obtained by Discrete Element Method (DEM) which applies Newton's laws of motion to every particle and the flow of continuum fluid is described by the local averaged Navier-Stokes equations that can be solved by the traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This method has been increasingly used worldwide, but so far its application is limited to relatively simple flow systems. In this work, the simulation is achieved by incorporating a DEM code into the commercial CFD software package Fluent that can be readily used for complex CFD problems. The applicability of this development is demonstrated in the study of the particle-fluid flow in various 3D systems including pneumatic conveying bend, cyclone separator and circulating fluidized bed. It is shown that the numerical results are, either qualitatively or quantitatively depending on the availability of experimental data for comparison, in good agreement with those measured, and can generate information leading to better understanding of the internal flow structure of these systems. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract  = {We describe simulation studies of the dynamics of spouted beds used for CVD coating of nuclear fuel particles. Our principal modeling tool is the Multiphase Flow with Interphase eXchanges (MFIX) code that was originally developed by the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) for fossil energy process applications. In addition to standard MFIX features that allow coupling of transient hydrodynamics, heat and mass transfer, and chemical kinetics, we employ special post-processing tools to track particle mixing and circulation as functions of operating conditions and bed design. We describe in detail one major feature of the dynamics, which is the occurrence of very regular spontaneous pulsations of gas and particle flow in the spout. These pulsations appear to be critically linked to the entrainment and circulation of solids, and they produce readily accessible dynamic pressure variations that can be used for direct comparisons of model predictions with experiments. Spouted-bed dynamics are important from a CVD perspective because they directly determine the magnitude and variability of the concentration and species gradients in the zone where reactant gases first come into contact with hot particles. As this unsteady spouted-bed environment differs from other types of CVD reactors, the design and scale-up of such reactors is likely to involve unique modeling issues. Our primary goal here is to lay the groundwork for how computational simulation can be used to address these modeling issues in the specific context of nuclear fuel particle coating. {\textcopyright} 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

  abstract  = {Predicting texture and physical properties of pyrolytic carbon (PyC) coatings produced by spouted bed coater/reactor has never been easy for specific yet critical hydrodynamic nature of the reactor. As a part of the TRistructural-ISOtropic (TRISO) coating for nuclear fuel applications, we have deposited PyC on surrogate zirconia particles by cracking of acetylene under variable static bed height, gas velocity and precursor concentration and characterized them thoroughly. From the analysis of samples, a correlation has been drawn between different experimental parameters and physical properties and texture of the said coatings. It has been shown that PyC with larger pores, higher degree of isotropic crystals and larger number of carbon atoms in lamellae are formed at higher spouted bed-height, whereas disordered crystals are produced at higher spouting gas velocities. Likewise, dense and hard coatings with smaller crystallite size are obtained with lower precursor concentration. The results have been adequately explained by invoking the droplet model. Our studies clearly shows that spouted bed hydrodynamics may be used to trap time frame of deposition, control surface temperature of spherical substrates and also the precursor gas concentration and thereby tailor the critical properties of the PyC coatings of TRISO coated particles.},

  abstract  = {A set of dimensionless groups has been proposed in the literature by He et al. (1997) to scale-up gas-solid spouted beds while maintaining their hydrodynamics similarity. The literature reported studies do not provide conclusive assessments about this methodology. Therefore, in this work, we have applied an advanced non-invasive Radioactive Particle Tracking (RPT) technique for the first time to evaluate such scale-up methodology by measuring the local solids velocity, normal and shear stresses and the turbulent kinetic energy. The axial and azimuthal averaged radial profiles of solids velocity, normal stresses, shear stresses, and turbulent kinetic energy illustrate that the similarity of the hydrodynamics has not been attained when the proposed set of dimensionless groups has been matched using two sizes of spouted beds of 0.076 m and 0.152 m and sets of operating conditions. The conclusion is consistent with the recent reported findings by measuring cross sectional distribution and radial profiles of solids and gas holdups along the bed height using gamma-ray computed tomography and by the limited point measurements of solids velocity and holdup using optical fiber probe. It is clear that local measurements of hydrodynamic parameters are essential for detailed assessment of scale-up methodologies. The presented results of our work in terms of the components profiles of the particles radial velocities and turbulent parameters are also valuable for benchmarking computational fluid dynamics codes and models.},

In our CFD-DEM approach both particles and droplets are treated as discrete elements. Before actual simulations were conducted, a number of tests were performed to determine the optimum particle collision time step by analysing the error in the prescribed restitution coefficient (difference between defined and applied values). Subsequently we test the model for a selected case as a proof-of-principle. In this test case, the effect of liquid injection on dynamics of a pseudo-2D spout fluidized bed with draft plates was demonstrated for the fluidized bed-spouting-with-aeration (dispersed spout) regime with injection of water droplets. The computational results were compared with experimental results that were obtained through a unique combination of particle image velocimetry (PIV) and infrared thermography (IRT).},

  abstract  = {The effects of electrostatic charge on powder flow behaviour during die filling in a vacuum and in air were analysed using a coupled discrete element method and computational fluid dynamics (DEM/CFD) code, in which long range electrostatic interactions were implemented. The present 2D simulations revealed that both electrostatic charge and the presence of air can affect the powder flow behaviour during die filling. It was found that the electrostatic charge inhibited the flow of powders into the die and induced a loose packing structure. At the same filling speed, increasing the electrostatic charge led to a decrease in the fill ratio which quantifies the volumetric occupancy of powder in the die. In addition, increasing the shoe speed caused a further decrease in the fill ratio, which was characterised using the concept of critical filling speed. When the electrostatic charge was low, the air/particle interaction was strong so that a lower critical filling speed was obtained for die filling in air than in a vacuum. With high electrostatic charge, the electrostatic interactions became dominant. Consequently, similar fill ratio and critical filling speed were obtained for die filling in air and in a vacuum.},

Unlike many previous N-body simulations on GPUs that scale as O(N2), the present method calculates the O(N logN) treecode and O(N) fast multipole method (FMM) on the GPUs with unprecedented efficiency. We demonstrate the performance of our method by choosing one standard application –a gravitational N-body simulation– and one non-standard application –simulation of turbulence using vortex particles. The gravitational simulation using the treecode with 1,608,044,129 particles showed a sustained performance of 42.15 TFlops. The vortex particle simula- tion of homogeneous isotropic turbulence using the periodic FMM with 16,777,216 particles showed a sustained perfor- mance of 20.2 TFlops. The overall cost of the hardware was 228,912 dollars. The maximum corrected performance is 28.1TFlops for the gravitational simulation, which results in a cost performance of 124 MFlops/{\$}. This correction is performed by counting the Flops based on the most efficient CPU algorithm. Any extra Flops that arise from the GPU implementation and parameter differences are not included in the 124 MFlops/{\$}.},

In general, Group A particles are fine and light, so that the adhesion force has a strong effect on their fluidization behavior. Inter-particle adhesion force of Group A particle was measured first. Secondly, the DEM-CFD coupling simulation with the measured adhesion force was performed, and the simulated results were compared with the experimental data about a small-scale fluidized bed for verification of the simulation. It was found from the results that there were considerable differences between their flow patterns. In order to reveal the cause of the differences, the effect of the adhesion force in the contact force model was studied on the motion of a single particle colliding with a wall.From the analysis on the particle-wall collision process, it is found that the spring constant used in the DEM model has a large effect on the particle's sticking behavior on the wall. The dynamic adhesion force model is proposed based on the present analytical investigation, and it is found that the present model well expresses the effects of the adhesion force on the flow structure for the case of a small adhesion effect. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract      = {Skin hyperpigmentation disorders can occur secondary to photodamage and as part of the skin aging process. Various pharmacologic agents that modulate the pigmentation process have been used clinically to reduce the appearance of pigmentation. The most widely used hyperpigmentation treatment is the topical agent hydroquinone, which has been considered the criterion standard for depigmenting agents. Hydroquinone can induce skin irritation, thus there is the need for safe and effective alternatives to treat hyperpigmentation. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the depigmenting efficacy of 4-hexyl-1,3-phenylenediol in vitro and in a double-blinded, randomized controlled clinical study. We showed that 4-hexyl-1,3-phenylenediol significantly reduced melanogenesis in primary human melanocytes, murine melanoma cells, and pigmented human epidermal equivalents. The mechanism for the reduction in melanogenesis was determined to be mediated through the inhibition of tyrosinase enzyme activity and protein expression, while no effect on tyrosinase gene transcription was detected. Further investigation revealed that the inhibitory effect of 4-hexyl-1,3-phenylenediol on melanogenesis is reversible and not associated with melanotoxicity, a concern associated with use of hydroquinone. A double-blinded, randomized controlled study clinical study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of a topical formulation containing 4-hexyl-1,3-phenylenediol. The study assessed efficacy and safety in Asian women over 12 weeks. Significant improvement was observed in the group using 4-hexyl-1,3-phenylenediol on dermatologist-graded parameters, such as overall skin lightening, appearance of spots on the cheeks, overall contrast between spots and surrounding skin, and overall pigmentation size compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, no product-related adverse events was reported. In conclusion, 4-hexyl-1,3-phenylenediol is a safe and effective topical agent that can significantly improve hyperpigmentation and is well-tolerated in longterm topical studies.},

By using this method as a preconditioner of the PCG method, an efficient method with high parallelism and fast convergence is obtained. First, it is considered a necessary condition of the multigrid preconditioner in order to satisfy requirements of a preconditioner of the PCG method. Next numerical experiments show a behavior of the MGCG method and that the MGCG method is superior to both the ICCG method and the multigrid method in point of fast convergence and high parallelism. This fast convergence is understood in terms of the eigenvalue analysis of the preconditioned matrix. From this observation of the multigrid preconditioner, it is realized that the MGCG method converges in very few iterations and the multigrid preconditioner is a desirable preconditioner of the conjugate gradient method.},

Such flows give rise to parabolic differential equations and so can be called three-dimensional parabolic flows. The procedure can be regarded as a boundary-layer method, provided it is recognised that, unlike earlier published methods with this name, it takes full account of the cross-stream diffusion of momentum, etc., and of the pressure variation in the cross-stream plane. The pressure field is determined by: first calculating an intermediate velocity field based on an estimated pressure field; and then obtaining appropriate correction so as to satisfy the continuity equation. To illustrate the procedure, calculations are presented for the developing laminar flow and heat transfer in a square duct with a laterally-moving wall. {\textcopyright} 1972.},

The gas/particle flow structure, the mean velocities and turbulent intensities can be predicted as a function of several operating parameters (particle size, bed temperature, and inlet gas velocity). The lower the inlet gas velocity, the higher the ratio of particle collision. The distributions of the particle anisotropic velocity show that the particles have no local equilibrium, and the distribution of gas kinetic energy corresponds to the distribution of gas-particle coupling moment in the fluidized bed. An intensive particle turbulent region exists near the wall, and the gas Reynolds stress is always much higher than the particle stress. The presence of the large reactive particles in the fluidized bed may affect significantly the gas and particle velocities and turbulent intensities.

  abstract = {Gas-solid flow dynamics is numerically simulated in an internally circulating fluidized bed (ICFB) featuring a centrally located baffle plate and uneven aeration. Its detailed features are derived using the computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM). The gas motion is resolved by means of large eddy simulation (LES) while the dynamics of solid phase is handled by the soft-sphere model. The internal circulation of the solids (spherical particles, with diameter of 1.2mm and density 1000kg/m3) is modeled to clarify the flow characteristics of the bed for different design or operating parameters, such as superficial gas velocity, gap height, inclination angle of the gas distributor, baffle plate or side wall of the bed. Both the gas-solid flow and the underlying mechanisms of solids circulation are addressed together with the simulation results. Meanwhile, the operational control behavior of different parameters is quantified by estimating both the solids circulation flux (SCF) and the gas bypassing flux (GBF). The computational results indicate that the performance of the bed can easily be regulated by adjusting the aeration to each chamber of the bed and that within the range tested, increasing gap height enhances solids circulation and suppresses gas bypassing. There is an optimal value for the inclination angle of both side wall and baffle plate. However, increasing the inclination angle of the gas distributor continuously suppresses solids circulation. Furthermore, the residence time of solids in each chamber is figured out and its variations with these design and operating parameters are examined. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Understanding the hydrodynamics of gas-solid flows is a grand challenge in mechanical and chemical engineering. The continuum-based two-fluid models (TFM) are currently not accurate enough to describe the multi-scale heterogeneity, while the discrete particle method (DPM) following the trajectory of each particle is computationally infeasible for industrial systems. Following our previous work, we report in this article a coarse-grained DPM considering the meso-scale structure based on the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model, which can be orders of magnitude faster than the traditional DPM and can take full advantage of CPU-GPU (graphics processing unit) hybrid supercomputing. The size and solids concentration of the coarse-grained particles (CGP), as well as their interactions with the gas flow (the drag) are determined by the EMMS model with a two-phase decomposition. The interactions between CGPs are determined according to the kinetic theory of granular flows (KTGF). The method is tested by simulating the onset of fluidization and the steady state flow in lab-scale circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers with different geometries and operating conditions both in 2D and 3D. The results agree well with experiments and traditional DPM based on single particles. The prospect of this method as a higher-resolution alternative to TFM for engineering applications and even for virtual process engineering is discussed finally.},

CFD predictions of solid phase velocity profiles and passage times were compared to experimental data obtained by a Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT) technique and Hall effect sensors, and a very good agreement was obtained considering the complexity of the flows studied. CFD predictions of solid-liquid pressure drop were compared to a number of relevant correlations gleaned from the literature. Only one of them showed a good agreement over the whole range of conditions studied. Other correlations generally showed large deviations from CFD, and their limitations in predicting the influence of solids concentration and particle size have been demonstrated. Overall, it emerged that for the flows studied, CFD was capable of giving predictions of pressure drop which were probably better and more reliable than the correlations available in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

It is shown that the convergence rate of the standard SIMPLE pressure-correction algorithm, which is used to solve the algebraic equation system that is produced by the finite volume discretisation, severely deteriorates as the Bingham number increases, with a corresponding increase in the non-linearity of the equations. It is shown that using the SIMPLE algorithm in a multigrid context dramatically improves convergence, although the multigrid convergence rates are much worse than for Newtonian flows. The numerical results obtained for Bingham numbers as high as 1000 compare favourably with reported results of other methods.},

With the boundary cut cells, special treatment is needed while integrating the governing equations. A novel hybrid technique involving surface cell trimming and interpolation is applied. To test the accuracy of this approach, it is applied to three benchmark cases: (i) flow in a plane channel skewed to the computational grid lines, (ii) wall-driven flow in an inclined box and (iii) flow past a cylinder. Agreement is found with analytical, numerical benchmark and experimental data. Results suggest that in many practical applications, false diffusion errors will be more significant than the cut boundary cell treatment.

Near this transition the hump curvature becomes very large and displays power-law scaling behavior. This scaling allows for steady-state hump profiles at different flow rates and tube heights to be scaled onto a single similarity profile.

Strong anisotropy of solid dispersion along the three directions is obtained. Systematic dispersion intensity along the vertical direction is an order of magnitude larger than the lateral one.

  abstract = {Industrial cyclones, such as gas, hydro and dense medium, are widely used in chemical, mineral and process industries to separate particles from fluids or classify particles by size, density or other solid properties. It is well known that the loading of particles can significantly affect fluid flow in such cyclones but the specific effect can be confusing due to a limited fundamental understanding of the working mechanisms involved. In this work, the problem is partially tackled by analysing the influence of particles of different size on the medium flow in a dense medium cyclone (DMC) by using a combined approach of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Discrete Element Method (DEM) (CFD-DEM). In the CFD-DEM model, CFD is used to model the motion of slurry medium by numerically solving the local-averaged Navier-Stokes equations at a computational cell scale, facilitated by the Volume of Fluid (VOF) and Mixture multiphase models. DEM is then used to model the motion of discrete particles by applying Newton's laws of motion, facilitated by a coarse-grained (CG) method to model small coal particles. It is found that both the particle and medium flows are sensitive to the particle size. The most notable finding is that spatial distributions of solid flow patterns form due to particles of different size have different trajectories in the cyclone. These lead to significant different distribution of volumetric particle-fluid interaction forces which cause different effects on the fluid flow. The findings are useful for developing a better understanding the working mechanisms of solids loading effects in DMCs and also in other similar swirling multiphase flow systems.},

We find that the ganglia configurations do not vary for small Ca; by contrast, as Ca is increased above a threshold value, the largest ganglia start to become mobilized and are ultimately removed from the medium. By combining our 3D visualization with measurements of the bulk transport, we show that this behavior can be quantitatively understood by balancing the viscous forces exerted on the ganglia with the pore-scale capillary forces that keep them trapped within the medium. Our work thus helps elucidate the fluid dynamics underlying the mobilization of a trapped non-wetting fluid from a 3D porous medium.},

  abstract = {A numerical methodology is presented for simulating 3D multiphase flows through complex geometries on a non-body conformal Cartesian computational grid. A direct forcing implicit immersed boundary method (IBM) is used to sharply resolve complex geometries, employing the finite volume method (FVM) on a staggered grid. The fluid-fluid interface is tracked by a mass conservative sharp interface volume of fluid (VOF) method. Contact line dynamics at macroscopic length scale is simulated by imposing the apparent contact angle (static or dynamic) as a boundary condition at the three-phase contact line. The developed numerical methodology is validated for several test cases including the equilibrium shape of a droplet on flat and spherical surfaces, the temporal evolution of a droplet spreading on a flat surface. The obtained results show an excellent correspondence with those derived analytically or taken from literature. Furthermore, the present model is used to estimate, on a pore-scale, the residual oil remaining in idealized porous structures after water flooding, similar to the process used in enhanced oil recovery (EOR).},

  abstract = {Gas–solid fluidization involving small amounts of liquid is simulated using a CFD-DEM model. The model tracks the amount of liquid on each particle and wall element and incorporates finite rates of liquid transfer between particles and pendular liquid bridges which form between two particles as well as between a particle and a wall element. Viscous and capillary forces due to these bridges are modeled. Fluidization–defluidization curves show that minimum fluidization velocity and defluidized bed height increase with Bond number (Bo), the ratio of surface tension to gravitational forces, due to cohesion and inhomogeneous flow structures. Under fluidized conditions, hydrodynamics and liquid bridging behavior change dramatically with increasing Bo, and to a lesser extent with capillary number, the ratio of viscous to surface tension forces. Bed fluidity is kept relatively constant across wetting conditions when one maintains a constant ratio of superficial velocity to minimum fluidization velocity under wet conditions. {\textcopyright} 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2017},

It has been found that a maximum flow rate is obtained at the critical filling speed for all systems investigated and poly-disperse systems have higher mass flow rates and higher critical filling speeds than mono-disperse systems. In addition, the powder with particles which can tessellate generally has a lower filling rate and a lower critical filling speed. {\textcopyright} 2008 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

This work presents a DEM-based approach for the analysis of energy transitions in such flows. The approach can consider the energy injection, dissipation and conversion due to driving forces such as particle-fluid interactions and the gravitational force, particle-particle/wall collisions and frictions. The effectiveness is demonstrated in two systems respectively and the transient and averaged energy transitions are discussed. The results reveal the connection between the formation of a cluster and the variation of energy in fluidized beds. From the viewpoint of energy transition, the results also illustrate the minimization of energy dissipation, the startup of fluidization and the particle flow distribution. Furthermore, the correlation of the contact between particles and the energy transition is demonstrated. The findings should be useful for the understanding of structure formation in fluidized beds and for industrial applications.},

The operating temperature was maintained in the range 700-850 °C, while the sawdust feed rate varied from 16 to 45 kg/h. Temperature, air ratio, suspension density, fly ash re-injection and steam injection were found to influence the composition and heating value of the product gas. Tar yield from the biomass gasification decreased exponentially with increasing operating temperature for the range studied. A non-stoichiometric equilibrium model based on direct minimization of Gibbs free energy was developed to predict the performance of the gasifier. Experimental evidence indicated that the pilot gasifier deviated from chemical equilibrium due to kinetic limitations. A phenomenological model adapted from the pure equilibrium model, incorporating experimental results regarding unconverted carbon and methane to account for non-equilibrium factors, predicts product gas compositions, heating value and cold gas efficiency in good agreement with the experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Heat transfer from a particle to gas was estimated using the Ranz–Marshall equation. The reaction rates were calculated by Arrenius type zero-th order kinetic expressions including the effect of catalyst weight. Hot spot formation at the bottom corner immediately above the perforated plate distributor was observed even when an equal amount of monomer gas was fed to all orifices. When the gas was not uniformly supplied, rather stable particle swirls formed in the bed creating a hot spot at the core of each swirl. The degree of mixing was found an effective parameter to predict the hot spot formation.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we describe a new Lagrangian-Lagrangian algorithm, which is referred to be the DEM-SPH method, for solid-liquid flows involving free surfaces. The DEM solid phase and the SPH liquid phase are coupled using the local averaging technique described by Lagrangian approaches, where both the continuity equation and the interaction force, i.e. drag force, are connected with the local mean voidage. Conservative forms of momentum transformation are derived for the DEM-SPH interaction via a variational approach. By introducing a correction to the SPH approximation with explicit inclusion of boundary information, arbitrary boundaries can be modeled without any extra wall particles, where the boundary is used commonly for both DEM and SPH phases. We deploy level-set distance functions to efficiently construct and evaluate this boundary model. To examine the validity of the present method, we perform three-dimensional simulations of a dynamic flow in a solid-liquid dam break and a quasi-steady flow in a rotating cylindrical tank; and we conduct validation experiments to justify the simulation results. In the dam-break problem, positions of wave fronts during the collapse are computed and compared with experimental measurements; for the circulating tank, some macroscopic aspects of the steady flow, e.g. the shape, dimension and velocity profile of the solid bed, are obtained for validation data. In both cases, the simulation results are in good agreement with those of the experiment. Consequently, the DEM-SPH method is proved to be adequate in modeling solid-liquid flows through this study. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Two-layer models, simpler than the distributed model, are explored. The deposit is considered to consist of two layers, fresh and aged; this simple picture is shown to be sufficient to interpret thermal and hydraulic aspects of deposit aging when HTDs are operated at constant heat flux (as reflecting laboratory experiments) but not in cases where the constant wall temperature approximation is more realistic.},

The effect of the drag force formulation and its associated application in the numerical model for both approaches in terms of their numerical accuracy, compared to experimental data is investigated, by implementing either the conventional Gidaspow model or the advanced EMMS one. Moreover, for the coarse grain CFD – DEM model, the range of values for important numerical parameters as the particle per parcel and cell to parcel size ratios are investigated to shed light on the necessary resolution such a model should have in order to reproduce valid and not parameter dependent numerical results. An adequate cell length to parcel diameter ratio is found to be around 2.6 while as concerns the parcel to particle diameter ratio a value around 58.5 proved to be sufficient, at least for the range of parameters investigated in this paper (size of riser, flow rates and particles average diameter). The EMMS model improved the accuracy of results derived by the coarse grain CFD – DEM model, while further research on the appropriate drag models for the coarse grain CFD – DEM is a sine qua non for its successful implementation in similar studies. For instance it is of interest to answer whether the individual particles slip velocity instead of the particles cell averaged slip, should be used for the calculation of the momentum interexchange coefficient ($\beta$) as well as the treatment of different particle diameters in the EMMS equation scheme.},

A flow regime map was constructed, revealing new regimes that were not reported so far. The multiple-interacting-spouts regime (C) has been studied in detail for a double- and triple-spout fluidized bed, where the corresponding fluidization regime for a single-spout fluidized bed has been studied as a reference case. The experimental results obtained with PIV and PEPT agree very well for all the three cases, showing the good performance of these techniques. The DPM simulation results slightly deviate from the experiments which is attributed to particle-wall effects that are more dominant in pseudo-2D beds than in 3D systems. The investigated multiple-interacting-spouts regime is a fully new flow regime that does not appear in single-spout fluidized beds. Two flow patterns have been observed, viz. particle circulation in between the spouts near the bottom of the bed, and an apparent single-spout fluidization motion at a higher location upwards in the bed. These findings show that the presence of multiple spouts in a spout fluidized bed highly affect the flow behaviour, which cannot be distinguished by solely investigating single-spout fluidized beds. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This method is a kind of semi-Lagrangian scheme and has been extended to treat incompressible flow in the framework of compressible fluid. Since it uses primitive Euler representation, it is suitable for multiphase analysis. The recent version of this method guarantees the exact mass conservation even in the framework of a semi-Lagrangian scheme. We provide a comprehensive review of the strategy of the CIP method, which has a compact support and subcell resolution, including a front-capturing algorithm with functional transformation, a pressure-based algorithm, and other miscellaneous physics such as the elastic-plastic effect and surface tension. Some practical applications are also reviewed, such as milk crown or coronet, laser-induced melting, and turbulent mixing layer of liquid-gas interface. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a coupling of Discrete Element Method (DEM) and Constrained Interpolation Profile (CIP) mainly designed for simulations of the nucleation process in wet granulation. The governing equations for fluid (liquid and gas) phases are the volume averaged form of the Navier-Stokes equation, continuity and colour function equations. These equations are solved by use of a meso-scale fixed Cartesian grid whose cell is larger than individual particles. The solid-liquid-gas interfacial effects on both fluid and particle phases are taken into account in the simulation. The surface tension effect on the fluid motion was modelled in three different ways depending on the relative position of the liquid-gas interfaces to powder beds: the models outside, inside, and on the surface of powder beds correspond to a free surface, capillary action and bed surface wetting. A new model for the surface tension effect on the solid (particle) motion, i.e. the capillary force effect, is proposed in this paper. This capillary force model is particularly useful when using a meso-scale fixed grid, and it can be used with various types of multi-fluid scheme such as CIP, Volume of Fluid (VoF) and Level Set methods. The proposed models are validated by comparing the simulation results with theoretical and experimental results. It is also revealed that the capillary force model is crucial to obtain reasonable simulation results for nucleation process. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Numerical simulation is useful both for the design and investigation of operational conditions in the industrial processes. However, numerical approaches for modeling solid-liquid flows were not yet established. This is because the modeling of the free surface and solid phase has been difficult and because the calculation cost may become huge. To solve the difficulties, we have developed a new method for numerical modeling of solid-liquid flows involving a free surface. In this study, we present the DEM-MPS method, in which solid-liquid flows are computed by combining the discrete element method (DEM) with the moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) method. Besides, new wall boundary modeling was proposed to perform the simulations of the solid-liquid flows in practical systems by the DEM-MPS method. The DEM-MPS method was validated against a solid-liquid flow in a rotating tank. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The two-dimensional numerical simulations are validated by comparing the wake size, drag coefficient and local heat transfer for flow past a circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers near 100. The central focus of the work, however, is in computing flows of liquid-solid mixtures, such as the classic shear-cell experiments of Bagnold. Hence, the simulations were performed for neutrally buoyant particles contained between two plates for different solid fractions, fluid viscosities and shear rates. The tangential force resulting from the presence of particles shows an increasing dependence on the shear rate as observed in the Bagnold experiments. The normal force shows large variations with time, whose source is presently unclear but independent of the direct collisions between particles and the walls.

Such commercial activities have prompted further fundamental research interest in fluid and bubble dynamics, transport phenomena and the scale up effects of three-phase fluidization systems. The fundamental behavior of particular relevance to these activities is associated with the elevated temperature and pressure conditions. This review attempts to summarize the salient characteristics of liquid, bubbles, and particles and their interactive behavior and dynamics in the process of bubble formation and bubble rising in gas-liquid-solid fluidization systems. Measurement techniques including both intrusive techniques such as the probes, and non-intrusive techniques such as tomography, that are used to study fluid and bubble properties in gas-liquid and gas-liquid-solid systems, are illustrated. Governing mechanisms of bubble-particle collision and bubble breakup are discussed. The state-of-the-art computational techniques, that consider both the discrete and the continuum approaches for movement of the particle and bubble phases along with the discrete simulation results, are presented. Of particular emphasis is the effect of pressure and temperature on the fluid and bubble dynamics in three-phase fluidization. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Phenomena related to phase change heat transfer are often encountered in engineering. These phenomena are regarded to be complex, since not only phase transition from solid to liquid occurs but also movement of fluid interface has to be taken into consideration. Detailed numerical modeling of these complex systems is essential to better understand them and optimize industrial designs. Lagrangian methods are promising for simulating such complex systems. The Moving Particle Semi-implicit (MPS) method, which is one of the Lagrangian methods, is employed here to simulate the free surface fluid flows involving heat transfer and phase change. On the other hand, the existing MPS method could not apply Neumann boundary condition such as heat flux in the heat transfer simulations. This is because the surface direction could not be readily defined on the surface of the spherical fluid particles in the MPS method. Hence, prescribing the heat fluxes becomes problematic in the existing MPS method. To solve this problem, a new heat flux model is developed, where the divergence operator is applied in the heat transfer simulation. Simple verification tests are performed to demonstrate the heat flux model, where the calculation results are compared against analytically derived solutions. In addition, application of the signed distance function is also investigated in the heat transfer simulation for arbitrary shaped boundary. In simple verification tests, the computation results are shown to agree well with the analytical solutions. Consequently, adequacy of the novel heat transfer model developed here is shown in the Lagrangian fluid dynamics simulation.},

  abstract      = {A second-order accurate, highly efficient method is developed for simulating unsteady three-dimensional incompressible flows in complex geometries. This is achieved by using boundary body forces that allow the imposition of the boundary conditions on a given surface not coinciding with the computational grid. The governing equations, therefore, can be discretized and solved on a regular mesh thus retaining the advantages and the efficiency of the standard solution procedures. Two different forcings are tested showing that while the quality of the results is essentially the same in both cases, the efficiency of the calculation strongly depends on the particular expression. A major issue is the interpolation of the forcing over the grid that determines the accuracy of the scheme; this ranges from zeroth-order for the most commonly used interpolations up to second-order for an ad hoc velocity interpolation. The present scheme has been used to simulate several flows whose results have been validated by experiments and other results available in the literature. Finally in the last example we show the flow inside an IC piston/cylinder assembly at high Reynolds number; to our knowledge this is the first example in which the immersed boundary technique is applied to a full three-dimensional complex flow with moving boundaries and with a Reynolds number high enough to require a subgrid-scale turbulence model. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},

  abstract  = {A comprehensive review of methods of numerically generating curvilinear coordinate systems with coordinate lines coincident with all boundary segments is given. Some general mathematical framework and error analysis common to such coordinate systems is also included. The general categories of generating systems are those based on conformal mapping, orthogonal systems, nearly orthogonal systems, systems produced as the solution of elliptic and hyperbolic partial differential equations, and systems generated algebraically by interpolation among the boundaries. Also covered are the control of coordinate line spacing by functions embedded in the partial differential operators of the generating system and by subsequent stretching transformation. Dynamically adaptive coordinate systems, coupled with the physical solution, and time-dependent systems that follow moving boundaries are treated. References reporting experience using such coordinate systems are reviewed as well as those covering the system development.},

The new procedure, based on methods used in thermal engineering, includes the effects of diffuse light sources of finite area, as well as the color-bleeding effects which are caused by the diffuse reflections. A simple environment is used to illustrate these simulated effects and is presented with photographs of a physical model. The procedure is applicable to environments composed of ideal diffuse reflectors and can account for direct illumination from a variety of light sources. The resultant surface intensities are independent of observer position, and thus environments can be preprocessed for dynamic sequences.},

  abstract  = {EPT PPT VPT+ST EPT PPT VPT+ST frame 100 frame 1000 Figure 1: Our method allows efficient rendering of dynamic, heterogeneous mixtures of grains, as demonstrated in the BOWL scene. We show two rendered frames of a simulation that was created with Houdini. The small images on the right of each frame show the individual components of our method, which add up to the full light transport. Explicit Path Tracing (EPT) simulates most of the high-frequency detail, such as glints. Proxy Path Tracing (PPT) accelerates the simulation using a precomputed aggregation of light scattering within each individual grain. Shell Tracing (ST) advances light through the medium in large steps using a precomputed aggregation of scattering events within large spherical regions. Across the entire simulation, we achieve a 2.5–5× speed improvement over the explicitly path traced reference. Abstract We address the challenge of efficiently rendering massive assem-blies of grains within a forward path-tracing framework. Previous approaches exist for accelerating high-order scattering for a limited, and static, set of granular materials, often requiring scene-dependent precomputation. We significantly expand the admissible regime of granular materials by considering heterogeneous and dynamic gran-ular mixtures with spatially varying grain concentrations, pack rates, and sizes. Our method supports both procedurally generated grain assemblies and dynamic assemblies authored in off-the-shelf particle simulation tools. The key to our speedup lies in two complementary aggregate scattering approximations which we introduced to jointly accelerate construction of short and long light paths. For low-order scattering, we accelerate path construction using novel grain scatter-ing distribution functions (GSDF) which aggregate intra-grain light transport while retaining important grain-level structure. For high-order scattering, we extend prior work on shell transport functions (STF) to support dynamic, heterogeneous mixtures of grains with varying sizes. We do this without a scene-dependent precomputation and show how this can also be used to accelerate light transport in ar-bitrary continuous heterogeneous media. Our multi-scale rendering automatically minimizes the usage of explicit path tracing to only the first grain along a light path, or can avoid it completely, when appropriate, by switching to our aggregate transport approximations. We demonstrate our technique on animated scenes containing hetero-geneous mixtures of various types of grains that could not previously be rendered efficiently. We also compare to previous work on a sim-pler class of granular assemblies, reporting significant computation savings, often yielding higher accuracy results.},

  abstract  = {The methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process is currently being implemented successfully in fluidized bed reactors (FBRs) in China. Characterizing the gas–solid flow is crucial in operating MTO FBRs effectively. In this work, a combined discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed to describe the gas–solid flow behavior in an MTO FBR. In this model, the particles are modeled using DEM, and the gas is modeled using Navier–Stokes equations. The combined model incorporates the lumped kinetics in the gas phase to achieve the MTO process. Moreover, the combined model can characterize the heat transfer between particles as well as that between the gas and the particles. The distinct advantage of the combined model is that real-time particle activity can be calculated by tracking the motion history of the catalyst particle with respect to heat transfer. The simulation results effectively capture the major features of the MTO process in FBR. Moreover, the simulation results are in good agreement with the classical calculation and experimental data. The particle motion pattern and distributions of a number of key flow-field parameters in the reactor are analyzed based on the validated model. The effects of operating conditions on FBR performance are also investigated. The simulation results show that the particle motion exhibits a typical annulus–core structure, which promotes excellent transfer efficiency. The results also demonstrated that the feed temperature, inlet gas velocity, and feed ratio of water to methanol significantly affect reaction efficiency.},

The shape and movement of solid geometries are efficiently represented by an auxiliary signed distance function (SDF) with local coordinate transformation. Validation tests have been conducted using the present method, and the computational results are in good agreements with reference solutions and experimental data.

In this paper we propose an interactive method based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate fluids with free surfaces. The method is an extension of the SPH-based technique by Desbrun to animate highly deformable bodies. We gear the method towards fluid simulation by deriving the force density fields directly from the Navier-Stokes equation and by adding a term to model surface tension effects. In contrast to Eulerian grid-based approaches, the particle-based approach makes mass conservation equations and convection terms dispensable which reduces the complexity of the simulation. In addition, the particles can directly be used to render the surface of the fluid. We propose methods to track and visualize the free surface using point splatting and marching cubes-based surface reconstruction. Our animation method is fast enough to be used in interactive systems and to allow for user interaction with models consisting of up to 5000 particles.},

  abstract = {The characteristics of the particle flow in a horizontal pipe following a 90° vertical-to-horizontal elbow were investigated both numerically and experimentally. Laboratory experiments were conducted in a 0.154 m ID test section. The effects of air velocity, the ratio of air-to-solids mass flow rate, geometry of the elbow and inlet conditions on gas–solid flow patterns were investigated experimentally. Pulverized coal with a mean particle diameter of 50 $\mu$m was used as the solid material. Experiments were performed with conveying air velocities ranging from 15 to 30 m/s and air-to-solids mass flow rate ratios of 1 and 3, with elbows having bend radius to pipe diameter ratios of 1.5 and 3. Measurements of particle concentration and particle velocity were performed at various locations along the horizontal pipe using a fiber-optic probe which was traversed over the pipe cross-section of the pipe. It was observed that the strong rope created by the elbow disintegrates within an axial distance of 10 pipe diameters. Fully developed concentration and velocity profiles were obtained within approximately 30 pipe diameters from the elbow exit plane. The rope behavior was different for the two elbows studied (R/D=1.5 and 3). The shapes of the fully developed profiles were found to be independent of inlet conditions.

  abstract  = {We present an efficient Lagrangian framework for simulating granular material with high visual detail. Our model solves the computationally and numerically critical forces on a coarsely sampled particle simulation. Pressure and friction forces are expressed as constraint forces which are iteratively computed. We realize stable and realistic interactions with rigid bodies by employing pressure and friction-based boundary forces. Stable formations of sand piles are realized by employing the concept of rigid-body sleeping. Furthermore, material transitions from dry to wet can be modeled. Visual realism is achieved by coupling a set of highly resolved particles with the base simulation at low computational costs. Thereby, detail is added which is not resolved by the base simulation. The practicability of the approach is demonstrated by showing various high-resolution simulations with up to 20 million particles. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

A numerical code is parallelized and more than 4.5million particles are tracked in the maximum by using 16 CPUs. To investigate the domain-size dependency, the cross-sectional area of beds is enlarged by the factors up to 82 and the results are compared. Under the ideal uniform inflow condition, multiple bubbles are spontaneously formed in large cross-section cases. The dependency of bubble size on the cross-section size is not so clear under the same bed height condition. Clear circulation patterns are observed in the time-averaged data. Down-flows of particles exist in low void fraction portions selectively with particle up-flows dominating in the high void fraction regions.

An example of such a boundary is the flexible leaflet of a human heart valve. It is the main achievement of the present paper that a method for solving the Navier- Stokes equations on a rectangular domain can now be applied to a problem involving this type of immersed boundary. This is accomplished by replacing the boundary by a field of force which is defined on the mesh points of the rectangular domain and which is calculated from the configuration of the boundary.

Change in the shape of lifters as they wear has a significant influence on grinding efficiency, and the annual cost of maintenance and mill down-time depends on the life of both liners and lifters. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is a computational method for simulating the dynamics of particle processes. This paper presents an analysis of 3D simulation of a grinding mill carried out using the EDEM software package customised to predict the rate of wear of lifter geometry and to enable progressive updating of worn lifter geometry profiles. A simplified breakage rate model is developed as a tool to correlate liner profile to mill performance. The combination of the prediction of liner profile and grinding rate shows promise to provide a powerful tool for advanced mill liner design - providing a means to balance liner life and mill performance over the life of the liner at the liner design stage. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The main advantages of this extension are the ease of implementation, the lack of grid artifacts, and the simple two-way coupling with other objects.

In this model, the particle-wall interaction is modeled with the gradient of potential energy. In this study, the physical phenomena involving granular flows are shown to be simulated precisely by using the new SDF. To prove the applicability of the new model to arbitrary shaped domains, the interaction of particles with vertical, horizontal, inclined, and curved surfaces is investigated in the present study. The new SDF model is shown to be as accurate as the existing mesh model through verification tests. In the current study, it is also shown that the new SDF can be applied to the moving boundary. Besides, the new model is proven to have high computational efficiency and to possess versatility which is extendible to be applied to cohesive particle systems. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The wetting fluid continues to flow around the ganglia after they form; this flow is characterized by a capillary number, Ca. We find that the ganglia configurations do not vary for small Ca; by contrast, as Ca is increased above a threshold value, the largest ganglia start to become mobilized and are ultimately removed from the medium. By combining our 3D visualization with measurements of the bulk transport, we show that this behavior can be quantitatively understood by balancing the viscous forces exerted on the ganglia with the pore-scale capillary forces that keep them trapped within the medium. Our work thus helps elucidate the fluid dynamics underlying the mobilization of a trapped non-wetting fluid from a 3D porous medium.},

  abstract = {Pneumatic drying is widely used in many engineering applications. It has been shown in earlier research [Fyhr C. and Rasmuson A., Mathematical model of a pneumatic conveying dryer, AIChE Journal, Vol. 43, pp 2889-2902, 1997.] that the U-bends in the pneumatic conveying dryer system significantly influence drying behavior since they create enhanced slip velocities between suspended material and the drying medium. On one hand, this slip will increase external heat and mass transfer rates, thereby enhancing drying conditions. On the other hand, increasing the number of bends will cause an increase in pressure drop. Use of the suitable mean gas velocity and the suitable bend radius ratio will result in a better design and improved operating conditions. Two-phase CFD calculations, using a Eulerian–Eulerian model and commercial program Fluent 6.0, were employed to calculate the gas and particle flows in a U-bend. Variables studied include: particle diameter, particle density, particle volume fraction, gas velocity and bend radius ratio. The numerical calculations were validated against experimental data from the literature. The density and diameter of particle vary from 600 up to 1000 kg/m3 and from 0.00025 up to 0.001 m, respectively. The gas velocity and particle volume fraction vary from 10 up to 25 m/s and from 0.001 up to 0.01 m3/m3, respectively. The bend radius ratio varies from 3 up to 8 m/m. The slip velocity is affected by all the studied parameters, in particular, particle diameter, gas velocity and bend radius ratio; whereas the total pressure drop is strongly affected by gas velocity and bend radius ratio. A low mean gas velocity will give a lower total pressure drop and longer particle residence time. A small bend radius ratio will produce a faster dispersion of particles, which benefits drying, but on the other hand, will increase the total pressure drop. Thus, optimizing gas velocity and bend radius ratio is important in reducing energy consumption.},

The influences of the coefficient of restitution due to non-ideal particle collisions on the simulated results were tested. It is demonstrated that the simulated result is strongly affected by the coefficient of restitution. Comparison of simulations with experiments in a small spout-fluid bed showed that an appropriate coefficient of restitution of 0.93 was necessary to simulate the flow characteristics in an underdesigned large size of spout-fluid bed coal gasifier with diameter of 1m and height of 6m. The internal jet and gas/solid flow patterns at different operating conditions were obtained. The simulations show that an optimal gas/solid flow pattern for coal gasification is found when the spouting gas flow rate is equal to the fluidizing gas flow rate and the total of them is two and a half times the minimum fluidizing gas flow rate. Besides, the radial distributions of particle velocity and gas velocity show similar tendencies; the radial distributions of particle phase pressure due to particle collisions and the particle pseudo-temperature corresponding to the macroscopic kinetic energy of the random particle motion also show similar tendencies. These indicate that both gas drag force and particle collisions dominate the movement of particles.},

These include the spatial organization of machine parts, conceptual architectural design, simulation of mechanisms, and industrial design. There has been moderate success in the automatic generation of wire frame, cardboard model, polyhedra, and quadric surface line drawings. The capability of the machine to generate vivid sterographic pictures has been demonstrated. There are, however considerable reasons for developing techniques by which line drawings of solids can be shaded, especially the enhancement of the sense of solidity and depth. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the value of shading and shadow casting in spatial description. In the line drawing there is no clue as to the relative position of the flat plane and the sheet metal console. When shadows are rendered, it is clear that the plane is below and to the rear of the console, and the hollow nature of the sheet metal assembly is emphasized. Shading can specify the tone or color of a surface and the amount of light falling upon that surface from one or more light sources. Shadows when sharply defined tend to suggest another viewpoint and improves surface definition. When controlled, shading can also emphasize particular parts of the drawing. If techniques for the automatic determination of chiaroscuro with good resolution should prove to be competitive with line drawings, and this is a possibility, machine generated photographs might replace line drawings as the principal mode of graphical communication in engineering and architecture.},

  abstract = {Abstract A mathematical model has been developed to investigate the mixing behaviors of solid particles within an inclined fluidized bed, which is a system of particular interest for applications of downcomers in circulating fluidized beds. Incorporating Newton's second law of motion for calculating particle motion, the interaction among particles is successfully simulated using the discrete element method (DEM), in which the motion of fluid is modeled in a two-dimensional scheme and the motion of spherical particles is considered in a three-dimensional domain. Based on simulations, as angles of inclination are increased from 0°, 10°, 20° to 30° with respect to the vertical axis, the simulations demonstrate particle mixing phenomena with respect to fluidizing characteristics. The simulations provide a unique microscopic viewpoint of particle motion inside the bed, which cannot be observed experimentally easily. Fractional fluidization arising from distribution of gas flow along the cross-section of the bed has been found to be affected by the angle of inclination. Moreover, knowledge of microscopic mixing of solid particles, caused by circulating flow, has been explored. "},

The particles are flattened near the particle-particle and particle-wall contact points, respectively, to avoid bad cell qualities. Compared to known methods from literature the modifications are so small that a subsequent correction of these modifications is not necessary. CFD simulations are performed for tube to particle diameter ratios of 3 ??? D/ d??? 10 in the laminar, transitional and turbulent flow regime and are compared with results from literature concerning porosity and pressure drop. The flow pattern within the bed is also investigated. The random fixed bed is generated with a DEM-code and the fluid domain is meshed with the commercial CFD code STAR-CCM+. The focus of this work is to verify, that physically correct results as well as meshes with a low number of cells and therewith short calculation time can be obtained with this new meshing method. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {The flow and segregation behaviours of the binary mixtures with different particle sizes during die filling in air and in a vacuum were investigated using a coupled discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in three dimensions (3D). Two types of computational setups were considered: i) a fully 3D model with real wall boundaries and ii) a thin sliced model with a slice of the full domain using two parallel periodic boundaries. Die filling with a stationary shoe and a moving shoe were simulated. It was found that the flow and segregation results obtained using the fully 3D and thin sliced models were essentially identical, implying that the thin sliced model can be used to simulate the die filling with a reduced computational time and good accuracy. It was also observed that, for die filling with a stationary shoe, the powder flow rate was reduced by the entrapped air in the die. For the die filling in a vacuum, vertical segregation occurred with a high concentration of fine particles at the bottom of the die as the fine particles can sift through the voids between coarse particles. The presence of air reduced the extent of this segregation by suppressing the percolation of fines through the voids. For die filling with a moving shoe, the effect of air on powder flow and segregation behaviours is negligible when the process is dominated by nose flow as considered in this study, since the air can readily escape from the die cavity. Segregation was also induced during die filling with a moving shoe, due to the free surface segregation and the filtration of fines through the voids between the coarse particles. Consequently, a high overall concentration of fines in the die was obtained, while the concentration of fines at the far end of the die was much lower than that at the near end. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

A connected region is formally defined as the collection of all pixels that are in the transitive closure of a pixel-connectivity operator that is applied to the seed. For example, the 4-pixel-connectivity operator selects all pixels that are (spatially) 4-connected to the pixel operand, and have the same color. This problem can be solved relatively easily if the fill color is distinguishable so that every pixel once colored (i.e. Flagged OLD) will not be considered again. In binary images the fill "color" is usually a binary pattern and therefore, a "colored" pixel may still have its previous (e.g., black or white) color. This.},

  abstract  = {The pneumatic transport of granular material is a common operation frequently employed to transport solid particles from one location to another. It is well established in the literature that different flow regimes can arise in such transportation processes depending on the system geometry and operating conditions used. In this study, the pneumatic transports of solid particles in both vertical and horizontal conveying lines were studied numerically using the discrete element method coupled with computational fluid dynamics. The simulation outputs corresponded well with reported experimental observations in terms of the different flow regimes obtained at different operating conditions. In the vertical pneumatic conveying simulations, two different flow patterns corresponding to the experimentally observed dispersed flow and plug flow regimes were obtained at different gas velocities and solid concentrations. Similarly, the homogeneous flow, stratified flow, moving dunes, and slug flow regimes previously reported to occur in horizontal pneumatic conveying were also reproduced computationally in this study. Solid concentration profiles obtained by spatial averaging along the length of the pipe showed a symmetrical but non-uniform distribution for dispersed flow and an almost flat distribution for plug flow in vertical pneumatic conveying. The profile for stratified flow in horizontal pneumatic conveying showed higher solid concentration near the bottom wall due to the effects of gravitational settling, while that for slug flow was flat. Hysteresis in solid flow rates was observed in vertical pneumatic conveying near the point where transition between the dispersed and plug flow regimes was expected to occur. Solid flow rates were also found to be more sensitive towards the coefficient of friction than the coefficient of restitution of particles and the pipe walls in a sensitivity analysis study of these parameters. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.},

  abstract = {A new gradient method for unconstrained minimization is proposed. The method differs conceptually from other gradient methods. Here the minimization problem is solved via consideration of the analogous physical problem of the motion of a particle in a conservative force field, where the potential energy of the particle is represented by the function to be minimized. The method simulates the motion of the particle and by monitoring its kinetic energy an interfering strategy is adopted which ensures that the potential energy is systematically reduced. An algorithm, representing this approach, has been extensively tested using seven different kinds of test function. The results are compared with the performance of other quasi-Newton methods. Overall the results are encouraging showing the method to be competitive and particularly robust and reliable. The evidence that the computational time required by the new method for convergence increases roughly linearly with the dimension of the problem is of considerable significance. ?? 1982 Butterworth {\&} Co.

  abstract = {Two approaches are commonly used for handling frictional contact within the framework of the discrete element method (DEM). One relies on the complementarity method (CM) to enforce a nonpenetration condition and the Coulomb dry-friction model at the interface between two bodies in mutual contact. The second approach, called the penalty method (PM), invokes an elasticity argument to produce a frictional contact force that factors in the local deformation and relative motion of the bodies in contact. We give a brief presentation of a DEM-PM contact model that includes multi-time-step tangential contact displacement history. We show that its implementation in an open-source simulation capability called Chrono is capable of accurately reproducing results from physical tests typical of the field of geomechanics, i.e., direct shear tests on a monodisperse material. Keeping track of the tangential contact displacement history emerges as a key element of the model. We show that identical simulations using contact models that include either no tangential contact displacement history or only single-time-step tangential contact displacement history are unable to accurately model the direct shear test.},

The incremental displacement-driven and force-driven constitutive relationships are developed. The importance of an adequate numerical treatment of the tangential component of the contact force is shown for the slide mode, and the recommendations for its evaluation are proposed. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated by solving the problem of the oblique impact of the spherical particle on the wall. The suggested methodology allows us to analyse the elastic and sliding effects of the tangential interaction more precisely than existing methodologies. Besides, the issue of the direction of the tangential force, when the Coulomb limit is reached, was reconsidered in one-dimensional case by taking three versions of the unit direction vector, which are based on the tangential elastic displacement, tangential stick force, and tangential relative velocity of the contact point of the particle.},

  abstract  = {In the present work, a numerical model is developed by means of CFD-DEM to study the behavior of cohesive particles in a spouted bed. In the model, the magnitude of the cohesive force was assumed as a specified constant which can be related to the cohesive force for molten particles or the liquid bridge force for wet particles. The evolutions of the flow patterns during the spouting processes at different cohesive forces were obtained. Particle concentration, velocity and circulation fluxes were systematically compared between cohesive and non-cohesive particles. Numerical results reveal that introducing the cohesive force will hinder the initiation of spouting from the compacted state of the bed. Increasing the cohesive forces leads to agglomeration, and correspondingly, higher gas velocities are required to break through the upper bed surface. When the cohesive force FCO = 5Fg, where Fgis the particle weight, the spouted bed can be operated properly similar to the non-cohesive one. When the cohesive force is further increased to FCO = 10Fg, obvious agglomeration appears at the moment of onset of fluidization. Particle concentration in the fountain region decreases apparently at the stable spout state because the cohesive force hinders the particle transfer from annulus to spout. The average particle velocity in the annulus decreases by about 50{\%} compared to the spouted bed of non-cohesive particles at the same spouting gas velocity Us. When the cohesive force FCO = 20Fg, de-fluidization happens in the spouted bed. Meanwhile, it is also found that the particle circulation fluxes under stable spouting condition decrease as the cohesive force increases at the same spouting gas velocity.},

The inter-particle and inter-phase interactions, heat and mass transfer, gas turbulence, radiation, particle conversion, drying, pyrolysis, and homogeneous reactions are synthetically considered. The method is validated with experimental data and simulation results, and the sensitivity analysis is conducted for assessing the influence of contact and drag models on the CFD-DEM simulation of biomass gasification. Results show that the magnitude of total calculation time for the non-linear Hertzian contact model is 6.8 times of that for the linear LSD contact model. The drag models significantly affect the gas-solid flow dynamics while having a slight influence on the thermochemical results obtained at the reactor exit. As a result, the present work delivers a promising perspective for modeling thermochemical processes (e.g., fast pyrolysis, coal combustion, iron smelting, and tablet coating) in dense reactive particulate systems by using the open-source MFIX-DEM software.},

In contrast, particle diameter has a negligible influence on instantaneous flow regimes and pressure drop. Under all the operating conditions considered, time-averaged variables including solid volume fraction, axial liquid velocity, and axial solid velocity all present maximum values in the middle of the pipe, which decline gradually in the radial direction toward the wall.

In the present study, a numerical technology is applied to an industrial incinerator to examine the effect of the control plate and to analyze the ash particle behavior. In the numerical simulations modeling of an arbitrary shape wall boundary and largescale simulation technique are required. In this study, advanced DEM-CFD method is employed, where coarse grain model of the DEM is used as scaling law modeling and signed distance function and immersed boundary method are applied to arbitrary shape wall boundary in the DEM-CFD method. The numerical simulations illustrate that the control plate works effectively, whereas, against all expectations, the ash particles are shown to remain in the incinerator not by collision to wall but by settling on the plate due to vortex.},

In this work, ellipsoids which can represent a large range of shapes varying from disk- to cylinder-type are used. The discrete element method is employed in order to conduct controlled numerical experiments. The results confirm the general findings reported in the literature. It also shows that with aspect ratios deviating from 1.0, the angle of repose increases significantly, but disk-type shape and cylinder-type shape follow different variation trends. Empirical correlations between the angle of repose and aspect ratio or sphericity are proposed. The analysis on the stress distribution shows that particle shape affects the magnitude of the normal contact force between particles significantly, with spheres being the smallest. The pressure distribution underneath sandpiles is featured with a relatively constant normal pressure in the central region rather than a dip. It is confirmed that non-spherical particles have more pronounced stress dip than spherical particles.},

For the data reported by Goldschmidt et al.

For the NETL data (Gopalan et al., 2016), all the drag models showed reasonable qualitative agreement for the radial profiles of the solid velocities; however, no single model resulted in close quantitative predictions. None of the models were found to be suitable for both data sets. The analysis suggests that the Ayeni model and Di Felice model provide better predictions than the conventionally used Gidaspow model and Syamlal–O'Brien model.},

The solid phase is composed of 178,200 particles of 883 $\mu$ m diameter and simulated by discrete element method (DEM, a soft-sphere approach). The gas phase is computed through solving the volume-averaged four-way coupling Navier-Stokes equations in which the Smagorinsky SGS tensor model is used in large eddy simulation (LES). Particle-tube collision is particularly treated as a transformation of DEM. The volume segmentation of a particle sphere for void fraction calculation is solved via a numerical sub-division approach. The numerical results are compared with the experimental results for validation. The results obtained with and without the LES model are also compared. The numerical results show a strong correlation between gas-particle interaction, particle-particle interaction, pressure drop, particle back mixing motion and bubble motion, and all of them follow a similar pattern of synchronous periodic variation though the periodicity may vary depending on different flow conditions. The effects of SGS tensor on evolution of fluidized bed are found in various aspects. Finally, the distribution of particle-tube impact frequency is given. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The characteristics of the flows in the start-up section are analyzed in detail and compared with those in the well-developed flow section for different flow regimes. On this basis, two semi-theoretical correlations are formulated to respectively predict the start-up section length and the relation between particle number and solid flowrate.

  abstract  = {The gas-solid flow in a fluidized bed is modelled by a combined approach of discrete particle method and computational fluid dynamics (DPM-CFD), in which the motion of individual particles is obtained by solving Newton's second law of motion and gas flow by the Navier-Stokes equation based on the concept of local average. The coupling between DPM and CFD is achieved directly by applying the principle of Newton's third law of motion to the discrete particle and continuum gas which are modelled at different length and time scales. The equations of motion for a system of particles are solved by a collision dynamic model developed in this work which, in conjunction with the predictor-corrector method, allows stiff particles ($\kappa$ = 50,000 Nm−1) to be used with a reasonable computational time step (1.5 × 10−5 s) while conserving the energy and momentum. The gas-phase equations are solved by the conventional SIMPLE method facilitated with the Crank-Nicolson scheme to give the second order accuracy in the time discretization. The proposed model shows its capacity of simulating the gas fluidization process realistically from a fixed to fully fluidized bed via an incipient fluidization stage. This is done by a series of numerical tests to reproduce the experimental procedures in determining the minimum fluidization velocity of 2400 particles (ϱp = 2700 kgm−3, D = 4 × 10−3 m) in a pseudo-three-dimensional central jet fluidized bed of dimensions 0.9 × 0.15 × 0.004 m. The hysteretic feature of bed pressure drop vs superficial gas velocity curve is obtained for the first time realistically from first principles, with the predicted minimum fluidization velocity in good agreement with experiment. It is demonstrated that the proposed model is able to capture the gas-solid flow features in a fluidized bed from the largest length and time scales relevant to the processing equipment down to the smallest ones relevant to the individual particles.},

Two injectors were considered: one with a straight needle and the other with a curved needle. The velocities of retinal cells in the injector with a straight needle were slightly higher than those in the injector with a curved needle. In addition, injection speed greatly affected the force distribution on retinal cells, with the retinal cells near the piston subjected to the highest forces during injection. The forces on retinal cells strengthened with increases in both retinal cell concentration and piston displacement.},

  abstract  = {With increasing computer power simulation methods addressing discrete problems in a broad range of scientific fields become more and more available. The discrete element method is one of these discontinuous approaches used for modeling granular assemblies. Within this method the dynamics of a system of particles is modeled by tracking the motion of individual particles and their interaction with their adjacencies over time. For the interaction of particles, force models need to be specified. The resulting equations of motion are of coupled ordinary differential configuration, which are usually solved by explicit numerical schemes. In large-scale systems like avalanches, planetary rings, hoppers or chemical reactors vast numbers of particles need to be addressed. Therefore, integration schemes need to be accurate on the one hand, but also numerically efficient on the other hand. This numerical efficiency is characterized by the method's demand for memory and CPU-time. In this paper a number of mostly explicit numerical integration schemes are reviewed and applied to the benchmark problem of a particle impacting a fixed wall as investigated experimentally by Gorham and Kharaz [Gorham, D. A., {\&} Kharaz, A. H. (2000). The measurement of particle rebound characteristics. Powder Technology, 112(3), 193-202]. The accurate modeling which includes the correct integration of the equations of motion is essential. In discrete simulation methods the accuracy of properties on the single particle level directly influence the global properties of the granular assembly like velocity distributions, porosities or flow rates, whereas their correct knowledge is often of key interest in engineering applications. The impact experiment is modeled with simple force displacement approaches which allow an analytical solution of the problem. Aspects discussed are the dependency of the step size on the accuracy of certain collision properties and the related computing time. The effect of a fixed time step is analyzed. Guidelines for the efficient selection of an integration scheme considering the additional computational cost by contact detection and force calculation are presented. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In these simulations, the die has been modeled by simple shapes such as cylinders and cuboids. However, industries require modeling of complex die shapes in the computations. In addition, the existing DEM is problematic from the viewpoint of industrial applications, since complexly shaped dies might not be modeled by existing technologies. To solve this problem, the signed distance function (SDF) model is applied to the DEM simulation (DEM/SDF) and the DEM/SDF approach is validated for arbitrarily shaped dies. Focusing on macroscopic powder flow, simulation results are compared with experimental results, and good agreement is confirmed for the spatial distribution of velocity, the projection areas of the shoe, and the final mass of filling particles. Therefore, the adequacy of the DEM/SDF model is newly demonstrated in the die filling system; i.e., the DEM/SDF method is shown to be an effective method for the numerical simulation of particle flow into arbitrarily shaped dies.},

  abstract  = {Abstract In this work, a numerical study of the gas–solid flow in a gas cyclone is carried out by use of the combined discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model where the motion of discrete particles phase is obtained by DEM which applies Newton's equations of motion to every individual particle and the flow of continuum fluid by the traditional CFD which solves the Navier–Stokes equations at a computational cell scale. The model successfully captures the key flow features in a gas cyclone, such as the strands flow pattern of particles, and the decrease of pressure drop and tangential velocity after loading solids. The effect of solid loading ratio is studied and analysed in terms of gas and solid flow structures, and the particle–gas, particle–particle and particle–wall interaction forces. It is found that the gas pressure drop increases first and then decreases when solids are loaded. The reaction force of particles on gas flow is mainly in the tangential direction and directs mainly upward in the axial direction. The reaction force in the tangential direction will decelerate gas phase and the upward axial force will prevent gas phase from flowing downward in the near wall region. The intensive particle–wall collision regions mainly locate in the wall opposite to the cyclone inlet and the cone wall. Moreover, as the solid loading ratio increases, number of turns travelled by solids in a cyclone decreases especially in the apex region of the cyclone while the width of solid strands increases, the pressure drop and tangential velocity decrease, the high axial velocity region moves upwards, and the radial flow of gas phase is significantly dampened.

The accuracy of the various models is assessed using quantitative data on shoulder, toe and vortex center positions taken from ensembles of both experimental and simulation results. These detailed comparisons reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the various models for simulating mills and allow the effect of different modelling assumptions to be quantitatively evaluated. In particular, very close agreement is demonstrated between the full 3D model (including the end wall effects) and the experiments. It is also demonstrated that the traditional two-dimensional circular particle DEM model under-predicts the shoulder, toe and vortex center positions and the power draw by around 10 degrees. The effect of particle shape and the dimensionality of the model are also assessed, with particle shape predominantly affecting the shoulder position while the dimensionality of the model affects mainly the toe position.

  abstract  = {The simulation is aimed at understanding the influence of magnetic properties in High Gradient Magnetic Separation processes. In HGMS magnetic particles are collected on magnetic wires for separation. External magnetic forces are calculated or simulated using the Finite Element Method and embedded first in a Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation. In the simulation, elliptic and rectangular wires aligned in field direction reach higher separation efficiencies than cylindrical wires. Magnetic forces from FEM with implemented dipole forces in a Discrete Element Method code show magnetically induced agglomeration and yield an acceptable agreement with experiments. Particle deposition on wires is investigated under the influence of different parameters. The porosity of the deposit is dependent on the magnetization of the wire and particles. A centrifugal force of 60. g has an important influence. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
